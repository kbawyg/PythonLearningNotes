70,US,"Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted.",86,12,Washington
80,Chile,"Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor.",86,12,Rapel Valley
90,US,"This blend of Sangiovese, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and other varieties plays well to type. It shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked.",88,23,California
100,US,"Fresh apple, lemon and pear flavors are accented by a hint of smoked nuts in this bold, full-bodied Pinot Gris. Rich and a bit creamy in mouthfeel yet balanced briskly, it's a satisfying white with wide pairing appeal. Drink now through 2019.",88,18,New York

120,Italy,"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.",92,70,Piedmont
130,Italy,"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.",91,70,Piedmont
140,Italy,"A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.",90,26,Piedmont
150,US,"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.",91,25,California
160,France,"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.",91,35,Southwest France
170,Germany,"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.",91,30,Mosel

200,Italy,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years.",90,20,Tuscany
210,South Africa,"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close.

230,US,"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",85,16,New York
240,France,"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",85,9,Southwest France
250,US,"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",85,49,California
260,US,"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.",89,40,Oregon

280,Austria,"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap.",92,24,Kremstal
290,France,"This is a wine that has great potential—you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017.",92,28,Bordeaux
300,US,"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",87,28,California

370,US,"Mint again, with earth and tobacco; one taster found traces of bell pepper. Coffee and brown sugar further soften a supple, mature mouthfeel. Drink now.",88,160,California
380,Chile,"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",88,12,Rapel Valley
390,Chile,"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.",88,12,Maipo Valley
400,Italy,"Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda. There's an interesting touch of crushed white peppercorn in there as well and this well-priced wine would make a perfect match to appetizers and finger foods.",85,13,Italy Other
410,US,"An elegant nose of violet and blackberry gives this Cab Franc a graceful start. On the palate, soft cherry and blackberry flavors are punctuated by spice and pepper. An interesting sip that will pair well with fowl, beef.",85,20,New York
420,France,"This is the first of 15 estates the Gonfrier family owns throughout Bordeaux. There are strong wood influences here, although the fruit is enough to match up. So ripe pear and apricot flavors go with those toasty characters to give a rich, full-bodied wine. It will be better from late 2016.",89,26,Bordeaux
430,US,"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy.",89,30,California
440,US,"This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.",89,38,Washington

480,US,"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%. Here are lightly earthy flavors of strawberry and herb, with a hint of green in the tannins.",87,45,Washington
490,Spain,"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",87,19,Catalonia
500,Spain,"Aromas of watermelon and a dusting of natural vanilla mark the bouquet. On the palate, it's fleshy but still crisp and focused, with nectarine, red apple and strawberry flavors. The finish lasts, with some sweetness.",87,11,Northern Spain
510,US,"Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.",91,48,California
520,US,"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",91,35,California
530,Chile,"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.",91,24,Colchagua Valley
540,US,"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.",93,60,California
550,US,"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach.",93,35,California
560,US,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",93,45,California
570,US,"Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together.",89,50,Washington

590,US,"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo.

600,Italy,"Crisp and light with pretty mineral dustings behind the ripe peach and melon aromas, this Gavi shows a full and generous style. Its nicest quality is that it offers both softness in the mouth and elegance on the bouquet.",87,19,Piedmont
610,US,"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink.",87,17,California
620,Italy,"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.",87,20,Veneto
630,US,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.",92,48,Oregon
640,US,"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.",92,37,California
650,Italy,"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.",92,24,Northeastern Italy
660,US,"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020.",90,80,California

690,Austria,"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",91,35,Burgenland
700,Argentina,"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.",91,30,Mendoza Province
710,New Zealand,"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.",91,120,Martinborough
720,Portugal,"Onion skin orange in color, this is a full and fat wine. It has attractive red-berry fruit and just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh and crisp. Drink now.",85,22,Alentejano

800,US,"With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors.",90,20,California
810,US,"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.",90,125,California
820,Spain,"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.",86,12,Northern Spain
830,France,"Crisp while also fruity, it has bright acidity, lively citrus and apple flavors and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",86,15,Beaujolais
840,France,"This is a rich style of rosé, rounded and fruity with good texture, wild strawberry flavors and very crisp acidity at the end. It's an attractive wine and one that's worth keeping until 2015.",86,20,Beaujolais
850,France,"Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.",90,117,Burgundy
860,US,"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.",90,45,California
870,US,"This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last.",90,29,California
880,US,"Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.",90,20,California
890,US,"If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.",90,28,California
900,Spain,"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.",90,48,Catalonia
910,Argentina,"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.",87,30,Mendoza Province
920,Australia,"Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish.",87,20,Australia Other
930,Argentina,"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",87,15,Mendoza Province

960,France,"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.",87,18,Bordeaux
970,US,"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.",85,19,California
980,Italy,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",85,41,Veneto
990,US,"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",88,12,California
1000,US,"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.",88,24,Oregon
1010,US,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",88,75,Oregon
1020,US,"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",88,14,Oregon

1050,US,"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",85,10,California
1060,France,"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.",85,11,Southwest France
1070,US,"This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.",94,62,Oregon
1080,US,"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.",94,32,Oregon
1090,Portugal,"Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026.",94,60,Port
1100,Chile,"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.",90,35,Maule Valley
1110,Spain,"With a black color and deep, resiny aromas of licorice, baking spices and black fruits, this is a big, Tempranillo with plenty of size and tannic bite.

1140,US,"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.",84,25,New York
1150,Chile,"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",83,11,Central Valley

1170,Argentina,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits.

1240,France,"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2?? years' aging.",88,40,Bordeaux
1250,Italy,"Spice, cherry cola and dried lavender emerge from the nose of this classy Riserva. The wine has elegance, harmony and a long finish thanks to the quality of its fruit and the natural acidity. Pair it with lasagna or meat-filled ravioli.",88,20,Tuscany

You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off.",86,13,California

1480,Chile,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua.

1660,US,"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting.",85,35,Oregon
1670,France,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,85,28,Bordeaux

1720,Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",85,10,Central Spain
1730,US,"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees.

1830,US,"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.",84,15,Oregon
1840,US,"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

2120,US,There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts.

2300,Germany,"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",90,36,Pfalz
2310,Germany,"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality.",90,40,Pfalz
2320,France,"This wine has ripe red fruit flavors, a dry core, balanced tannins and plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.

2340,US,"Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure.",85,10,Washington

2430,US,"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor.",85,14,Oregon
2440,US,"This very approachable and likable wine puts the typical dried-grass aromas atop stone fruit scents. The palate is very herb-tinged, with parsley, thyme and rosemary finding a nice symbiosis with the riper nectarine and melon flesh.",90,14,California

2590,US,"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",90,35,Washington

2630,US,"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",82,14,California
2640,Australia,"This pale salmon rosé is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.",90,22,Tasmania

Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.",90,36,California

While it's not common for Stags Leap wines to have these characteristics, it is incredibly deep in black cherries, milk chocolate and oak, with a spicy finish that goes on for a long time, indicating the power of this Cabernet. Drink over the next six years.",90,150,California
2700,US,"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",87,25,California
2710,US,"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine.",87,32,California

2760,Chile,"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",84,13,Colchagua Costa
2770,US,"Rather vegetal aromas of jalape?o and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers.",84,26,California

2850,US,"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures.",88,25,California
2860,Italy,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with subtle aromas of red berry and leather. The smooth palate doles out mature black cherry and clove alongside chewy tannins.",88,35,Tuscany
2870,Italy,"Candied fruit, caramel, smooth vanilla cream and apricot open the opulent bouquet of this beautifully made Riserva Chardonnay. Elena Walch produces one of the best, oak-aged expressions of the grape in Italy. It closes with creamy richness and persistence.",91,37,Northeastern Italy
2880,US,"Shows Petite Sirah's tremendous power, with full-bodied blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and pepper flavors, and there's a wonderful meatiness suggesting charred beef fat.

2890,France,"This wine from Ch?teau Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core.

2950,US,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now.

It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",86,30,Oregon
2960,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",86,25,Northern Spain
2970,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on.

There's a fair amount of acid for an ??3, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",85,29,Central Spain
2980,France,"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long.",91,33,Alsace
2990,US,"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness.",91,32,California
3000,Germany,"Whiffs of candlestick and honeycomb lend subtlety to zesty white-grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry Riesling. While rich, round and supple in mouthfeel, it's balanced squarely by acidity and a pleasant bite of lemon zest.",91,20,Mosel
3010,France,"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes Ambré, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent.",93,36,Languedoc-Roussillon
3020,US,"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6?? years.",92,49,California
3030,US,"Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood. It defines Napa richness, but it is too tannic and immature to properly enjoy now. Give it a snooze for 6?? years.",92,75,California
3040,Spain,"This salmon-colored rosé is made from the Trepat grape. It smells common, with yeasty bready notes of orange peel and orange blossom. A basic palate is balanced, while this tastes of leesy dried melon prior to a medium-long finish.",88,17,Catalonia
3050,Italy,"Light bodied and fresh, this has alluring scents of small red berry, aromatic herb and a floral note. The vibrant palate delivers tart red cherry, white pepper and a hint of thyme. Firm acidity and pliant tannins provide the easy-drinking framework",88,22,Lombardy
3060,US,"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",88,50,Oregon
3070,US,"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah.

3080,Australia,"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink now??020.",94,105,South Australia
3090,Italy,"Campo Leòn is a jammy, chewy wine with raw notes of black cherry, Indian spice, cedar wood and melted chocolate. It's thick, syrupy and it's hard to imagine a balanced food pairing outside succulent red meat.",88,55,Veneto

3110,Chile,"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better.",88,49,Colchagua Valley
3120,Argentina,"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance.",84,22,Mendoza Province
3130,US,"At this price, and with a case production of 110,000, lots of Americans will consider themselves lucky to have a solid red wine like this. It's not terribly complicated, but offers easy flavors of cherries and oak.",83,8,California
3140,US,"The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine. They range from cherries and cola to sweet cured tobacco and buttered cinnamon toast to smoky vanilla. If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher.",89,44,California
3150,US,"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.",89,22,California

3180,France,"This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine. It is lightly wood aged to smooth out the ebullient fruits. Rich and with some firm tannins that will develop, it has concentration and a dense texture. Drink from 2018.",90,22,Beaujolais
3190,US,"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.",90,38,California
3200,France,A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.,90,21,Beaujolais
3210,Spain,"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",88,45,Northern Spain

3230,US,"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",88,35,California
3240,US,"A gentle wine, this has warm, fruity aromas, ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors, a soft texture and fine-grained tannins. Medium to full bodied and almost sweet in balance, it's easy to enjoy.",86,15,California

3270,France,"This is a traditional style—emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edges—but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",87,50,Southwest France

3310,Italy,"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral.

3320,Israel,"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken.

4590,US,"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",87,18,California
4600,US,"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",87,16,New York
4610,France,"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Ch?teauneuf, this is a solid C?tes du Rh?ne, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",87,16,Rh?ne Valley
4620,US,"Hearty aromas of black cherry and mulberry meet with rustic iron, dark spice, crushed slate and dried sagebrush on the expertly woven nose of this bottling by a Southern California-based vintner. The palate balances bright acidity with upright tannins, allowing the dark-red fruit and mace spice flavors to shine.",94,40,California
4630,Italy,"Dark-skinned berry, exotic spice, blue flower and wild herb aromas take center stage in this Barolo.

Drink 2023??033.",94,57,Piedmont
4640,US,"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.",94,44,California

4670,US,"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",91,75,California
4680,US,"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality.",91,24,Oregon
4690,US,"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",91,35,California
4700,France,"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front. Probably as it softens it will round out, so wait until late 2016 to drink.",87,18,Loire Valley
4710,Italy,"Aromas of dried berry, plum, rose and underbrush lead the nose. The easygoing palate offers raisin, blackberry jam, walnut and black pepper. Enjoy through 2017.",87,20,Piedmont
4720,Portugal,"A surprisingly fresh wine for an Alvarinho from the hot Alentejo. It shows crisp acidity, with lime and apricot flavors and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",87,14,Alentejano
4730,US,"An earthy, leathery, spicy nose dominates this 100% Cabernet from 17-year-old vines. This is an elegant, complex, earthy wine, beautifully balanced with classic cassis laced with leather, barnyard, coffee, smoke and spice. 180 cases made.",91,32,Washington
4740,US,"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",90,23,Washington
4750,US,"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",89,45,California
4760,Spain,"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.",90,20,Northern Spain
4770,Italy,"This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather.

Drink 2016??024.",90,,Tuscany
4780,US,"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare.

4810,US,"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves.",85,48,California
4820,US,"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",85,15,Washington
4830,US,"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",85,30,California
4840,Portugal,"Towards the western end of the Douro vineyards, Avidagos is a fine place for table wines. This young, ripe and rounded wine is made to be drunk young. It has great black fruits and acidity that are linked by the firm tannin background. The wine will be ready from the end of 2016.",87,15,Douro

4860,Italy,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Mammolo, this shows aromas of black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of orange peel. The soft, easygoing palate offers red plum and a hint of clove alongside rounded tannins.",87,15,Tuscany
4870,US,"Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.",87,26,Oregon
4880,Italy,"Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs. The palate is dominated by oak, vanilla and coffee that muffle the dried dark-cherry and mineral flavors. It has a linear quality but lacks fruit richness and is still in the vice-like grip of wood tannins.",87,40,Lombardy
4890,Chile,"Concentrated scents of iodine, olive and herbal blackberry set up a loud palate supported by noticeable acidity. This tastes briny and a bit salty, with herbal black plum and blackberry flavors. A note of prune on the finish is offset by vivid acidity.",87,15,Maule Valley
4900,US,"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019.",91,21,California
4910,Portugal,"Still firm in tannins, this has developed into an austere and dark wine. It is serious and solid, with a firm, brooding character and layers of acidity as well as black currant fruits. It is probably ready to drink now.",91,24,Alentejano
4920,US,"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.",91,48,California

4940,US,"Hard to say if this is a dessert wine or a rosé, because it's fairly sweet. Let's call it a rosé. And a pretty one it is, with savory orange, raspberry and vanilla flavors, balanced with acidity.",86,9,California
4950,France,"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",86,,Bordeaux
4960,Italy,"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or p?té. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",90,23,Northeastern Italy
4970,France,"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together",90,29,Loire Valley

5000,Germany,"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart.",88,27,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
5010,US,"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.",95,59,California
5020,US,"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release. Smooth as silk, it mixes berry, cherry and plum notes, with whiffs of smoke, green tea, and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.",94,75,Washington
5030,US,"From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.",91,36,Washington
5040,US,"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed.

5050,France,"A rich and medium sweet wine, full of spice, lychees and ripe fruits. There is a tangy texture, a strong sense of minerality as well as herb, yellow fruits and nutmeg flavors. It is still young and needs time. Drink from 2017.",91,,Alsace

5080,US,"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.",87,20,Oregon

5100,Chile,"Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors. A dry finish turns hot, an appropriate ending to this tightly wound Pinot Noir.",86,20,Casablanca Valley

5120,US,"Baked black cherry, rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic, earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton. Garrigue is prominent on the tip of the sip, with strong but not overripe black cherry and plum flavors. These lead into forest floor, juniper, pine needle and mulling spice on the finish.",92,50,California
5130,France,"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais. Drink from 2018.",92,43,Beaujolais
5140,Chile,"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018??028.",92,26,Colchagua Valley
5150,US,"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",87,32,Oregon
5160,US,"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3?? years, but it's somewhat risky.",87,45,California
5170,Spain,"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",87,22,Northern Spain
5180,Italy,"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",90,25,Tuscany
5190,Italy,"Made with Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this wine begins with typical Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, leather, spice and ripe berries.

Drink through 2018.",92,18,Sicily & Sardinia
5230,France,"Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration. Layers of black fruits and acidity need time to integrate fully with the dark structure and dense texture. Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018.",91,104,Burgundy
5240,France,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this négociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now??025.",91,57,Rh?ne Valley
5250,Spain,"Smoky, oaky aromas of popcorn and buttered toast are louder than this bubbly's citrus and white-fruit scents.

5260,US,"Though sourced principally from Red Mountain grapes, where the Col Solare winery is located, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux-style blend is simply labeled Columbia Valley.

5350,US,"This is a really well-made, traditional and tasty wine with flavor complexity, nice balance and the kind of firm texture that pairs well with grilled and roasted meats.

5500,US,"Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors.

5510,Austria,"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity.

5530,Chile,"This rosé is made from Cabernet Franc grapes, and it's briny to an extreme, with vegetal aromas. The palate is scattered in feel and lacks grace, while pickled citrus dominates the flavor profile. A mustardy, briny finish with jalape?o notes is no savior.",82,17,Casablanca Valley
5540,Spain,"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",82,12,Northern Spain

Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.",90,13,Andalucia

5730,US,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (91%) along with pinches of Syrah and Merlot.

5740,US,"This 100% varietal wine was aged in differing levels of oak, from 33% new French to once and twice-used (also French). It makes for a bold presence of thick soft black plum and licorice complemented by long-lasting texture and a length of leather.",90,35,California

5840,US,"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors.",88,20,California

6150,New Zealand,"A strong effort from Vavasour's second label, the 2008 Dashwood SB features vibrant aromas of crushed tomato leaf and hints of jalape?o and flavors of green tomato and gooseberry.

It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",94,150,California
6280,US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",94,55,California

A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience.",91,75,California
6340,US,"Violet, sarsaparilla, crushed stone and dark berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling from Mourvèdre master Ryan Pease. Still quite young, it shows black plum, black fig, loamy earth and roast pork flavors and is bit richer and riper than his other bottlings.",91,52,California

6420,France,"Cedar, red cherries and woodsy mineral notes make for a fairly complex opening. The palate is crisp, with lovely tar and leather notes framed by soft tannins that persist on the moderately long finish. An elegant choice to accompany steak.",85,9,Languedoc-Roussillon
6430,France,"A rich, ripe and finely balanced wine. Its acidity cuts through the full pear and apricot flavors to give a tight crispness.

6440,France,"A big, complex wine from this continually improving property, this is now performing at its classed-growth level with concentrated ripe berry fruits and chocolate flavors.

6490,US,"Syrupy and with a distinct taste of raisins, this 100% varietal wine is overdone in terms of ripeness, with a lack of structure. The highlight is its tight hold on black pepper.",82,40,California
6500,Argentina,"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are probing and raw. This feels acidic to the point of cutting. Sour, salty, herbal red-fruit flavors are gritty and rough on the finish. This is Salta Cabernet in its most raw, least appealing form.",82,11,Other

6570,US,"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",94,100,California
6580,US,"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.",94,84,Washington

6930,US,"Deep, dense black cherry signals immediately that this is pure, classic Dundee Hills fruit, much of it from Abbey Ridge. Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity.

7030,US,"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel.

7190,US,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",90,70,California

7320,US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",82,20,New York
7330,US,"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",81,44,California

Drink now.",86,18,Burgundy

8000,US,"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure. But the raspberry, vanilla, toast and spice flavors are fine for drinking now.",87,50,California
8010,France,"This medium-bodied, cheerful blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah displays likeable peppery notes accenting bright cherry fruit. It's dangerously easy to drink. Best now and over the next year or so.",87,13,Rh?ne Valley
8020,Portugal,"Here's a ripe, earthy wine that is softly tannic and richly fruity. It has a fine balance between the warm blackberry fruits and solid structure. Made to be drunk young, it is already delicious. Screwcap.",86,8,Alentejano
8030,US,"This fruit-driven Pinot Gris blends green apple, melon and pear, with a hint of celery suggesting some less-than-ripe fruit in the mix also. The finish turns a little bitter.",86,13,Oregon
8040,Chile,"Dry spice and plum flavors are lean but fair. This feels snappy, crisp and high in acidity, while flavors of plum and berry are loamy and finish mild except for a touch of residual zesty acid.",86,12,Colchagua Valley
8050,France,"This blend of 45% Grenache Blanc, 25% Roussanne, 15% Clairette and 15% Viognier features notes of melon, banana and pineapple backed by a hint of wet stone. It's medium to full in body, with a silky texture, then thins out a bit on the tart finish. Drink up.",86,15,Rh?ne Valley

8070,Italy,"Aromas recall blue flower, new leather, truffle and crushed raspberry. The bright palate offers wild cherry, cake spices, alpine herbs and a sprinkling of cocoa. It's well balanced and fresh with firm but fine tannins.",91,,Piedmont
8080,US,"From 100% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grown in the heart of the Stags Leap District, this earthy red offers black tea and coffee aromas and flavors, suggestions of wild sage and black pepper enveloping the nose. Medium to full-bodied, elegant and well-composed, the tannins are soft and structured, the wine able to age, drinking well now through 2020.",91,80,California
8090,US,"Crafted from Wente clone grapes from Charles Ranch, this label is the passion project of longtime wine industry player Tony Lombardi, who manages the much larger Kosta Browne brand. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak this wine offers heady Tahitian vanilla and lemon curd around green apple skin and lemon. The palate is both creamy and crisp, the finish reasonably powerful.",91,36,California
8100,New Zealand,"Thick, unctuous and impressive, this is one seriously sweet Sauvignon Blanc. Honey and bergamot notes mark the nose, while the palate features more citrus and folds in hints of pineapple as well. Long and sticky on the finish.",93,35,Marlborough
8110,Argentina,"Rich aromas of raisin, cassis and blackberry are supported by notes of vanilla, smoke and sweet almond paste. While this is dense and ripe, it's also a touch edgy and raw on the palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, dark spices and chocolate finish with a primary wave of residual fruit then a final dose of peppery spice. Drink through 2025.",93,50,Mendoza Province
8120,France,"This Premier Cru is situated in the southern half of Savigny, close to Beaune proper. Here it has produced a ripe generous wine full of spicy smoky red fruits and balanced acidity. The wine is still showing its baby fruit and needs time. Drink from 2019.",93,70,Burgundy
8130,France,"This is a fruity wine, gentle with its white fruits and citrus flavors. It has just a touch of minerality from the granite soil that brings out acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now.",88,12,Loire Valley
8140,Argentina,"Berry aromas with subtle spice accents are damp and soothing. In the mouth, this is the opposite: All dry tannins and rawness. Hard-driving black-fruit flavors pull up short on a peppery finish. It's an honest but rough wine.",87,20,Mendoza Province
8150,US,"This small-production wine is lightly spiced, robust and herbal. Dense and powerful wild strawberry and earth notes give it a sense of place.",87,45,California
8160,Italy,"Aromas of honeysuckle, exotic fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub take center stage. The tangy palate offers grapefruit, peach and pineapple alongside crisp acidity.",87,13,Sicily & Sardinia
8170,Armenia,"Medium straw in the glass, this wine has a nose of pineapple and white melon. Soft on the palate, it offers flavors of grapefruit, papaya and rose. Lingering brightness on the finish is bolstered by a hint of pear.",87,14,Armenia
8180,US,"This wine is 80% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache. It brings unusual aromas of sawdust, mushroom, Band Aid, dark fruit and spice. The palate is lush and full, showing warmth on the finish.",87,28,Washington
8190,US,"Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality.",91,21,California
8200,US,"A very good wine that easily earns its score, but is not perfect. It's a bit on the fruity-sweet, one-dimensional side, with jammy pineapple and apricot flavors, enriched with sweet, smoky, vanilla-accented oak. Yet fine, firm coastal acidity provides needed balance.",91,48,California
8210,US,"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now. The flavors offer an interesting mélange of blackberries, black currants, green olives, sage and cinnamon. This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so.",92,75,California
8220,US,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage.",92,24,Oregon
8230,Canada,"This wine is the vinous equivalent of biting into a ripe, juicy mango that has been drizzled with honey. It's viscous and full in feel, loaded with tropical flavors that linger on the finish. Perhaps a bit one note but represents it well.",92,70,Ontario

8250,US,"Flavors of rich, ripe blackberry jam, mocha and toast are wrapped into firm but refined tannins in this Cabernet.

8260,US,"This exceptionally pretty Blaufr?nkisch is sultry on the nose, offering notes of preserved blackberry and blueberry. The palate is rich and ripe, with crème de cassis flavor, brightened by tart acidity and a flourish of violet on the finish.",89,38,New York
8270,France,"Superripe and rich, very creamy, buttery and with a significant amount of toasty oak. The wine is open and generous, although retaining acidity and citric flavors.",88,,Burgundy
8280,Italy,"There's a grittiness or tightness of texture here that recalls carob or dried prune. This quality makes for an interesting, food-friendly red that is further colored by tones of chocolate, leather and pipe tobacco. Pulpy, dark concentration is backed by drying tannins.",88,,Piedmont
8290,France,"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",92,91,Rh?ne Valley
8300,Austria,"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy.",92,28,Kamptal
8310,US,"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish. It is structured with enough fine-grained tannin to age gracefully, so it's best to drink after 2019.",92,25,California
8320,US,"Barrel fermented in French and eastern European oak, this is lightly aromatic with notees of butter, vanilla and cardamom with a creamy feel, showing some heat on the finish.",87,20,Washington
8330,US,"There's a bit of oak in this Riesling, just enough to give some mellowness to the tart apricot, citrus and white flower flavors. It's bone dry and acidic, with a mineral intensity that finishes with elegance and style.",87,38,California
8340,France,"This wine is at just the right moment of maturity. It's on the dry side, but with just a touch of rich honey flavor. It is ripe, full in the mouth, finely perfumed and ready to drink now.",87,20,Alsace
8350,US,"This wine hails from the family's Eastside Road vineyard, planted to old Wente Chardonnay in 1982. It boldly opens in a robust, full-bodied explosion of ripe tropical mango and dried apricot, with an oaky underbelly that gives the texture grip and additional density.",87,40,California

8370,Spain,"Lazy raisiny aromas reflect a very warm vintage. In the mouth, this Graciano is fat, with dense, plodding tannins. Raisin and prune flavors are chewy and exceedingly ripe, while this is obtuse on the finish.",87,75,Northern Spain
8380,France,"Always an impressive vineyard, it has produced a dense wine in this vintage. It's full of both intense, perfumed red fruits and smoky, dusty tannins that give an elegant structure. Drink from 2020.",92,68,Burgundy

8400,US,"Hay yellow in color, with a wispy shade of pink in the core, this bubbly shows aromas of lemon chiffon, sourdough toast, white peach and a touch of quinine on the nose. Lemon peel and curd show strongly on the palate, laid across a salted cracker flavor—quite delicious and refreshing at once.",92,42,California
8410,US,"This 76% Cabernet Franc and 24% Malbec blend pushes the coolness of the vintage and the appellation in its extremely herbal, woody nose, a taste of bell pepper rising midway through its lean palate. It finishes round and soft.",85,84,California
8420,France,"This fruity wine has soft and tannins and a jammy backdrop. It is ripe and full in the mouth with strawberry and red plum jelly flavors. Drink now. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership.",85,16,Burgundy
8430,Chile,"Scattered aromas of black olive and stewed berry fruits lead to a heavy, awkward palate. This tastes strained, with burnt, leafy black-fruit flavors and a soft, low-acid finish.",85,35,Colchagua Valley
8440,US,"Whatever the blend is on this red wine, and winemaker Heidi Barrett isn't saying, it's really interesting. The bottle is old-fashioned and stubby, like something from the 1700s. The wine itself is immediately likeable for its spicy array of spices and berries. Despite its upfront appeal, there's a complexity that elevates it.",92,60,California
8450,US,"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style. This is simply enchanting, like raspberry-infused silk dusted with brown butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",92,40,California
8460,US,"Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidity—as pert as a squeeze of lime. Delicious, full bodied and exotic, it defines its vineyard and appellation.",92,32,California
8470,US,"Aromas of cedar and damp soil lend a clean, foresty air to this beautifully ripe yet restrained Bordeaux blend. Black fruit flavors are intensely concentrated yet brisk with acidity, strident grape tannins and a lingering granite finish.",88,70,New York
8480,Germany,"It's labeled dry, but this wine comes across as just slightly off dry, with ripe melons and pears taking the lead and never looking back. It's plump on the palate, finishing with a teasing sense of sugar. Drink now.",88,16,Mosel
8490,US,"Feels too soft and rather one-dimensional, although the flavors are very good. The best thing about the wine, aside from dryness, is the richness of tannins. The fruit veers toward blackberry marmalade and currants. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",86,28,California
8500,France,"The balance between the firm tannins and ripe fruit works well here. The texture is dense, rough at the edges but with good layers of wood, acidity and dry tannins. The aftertaste has welcome freshness.",86,22,Southwest France
8510,New Zealand,"Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center. The only concern is the slightly drying finish and some slightly coarse, rustic tannins. If those resolve gracefully, this rating may look stingy in 3 years' time.",86,55,Marlborough
8520,US,"An intriguing, distinctive nose combines hickory smoke, baked raspberry and a touch of sage. Dark-red cherry and cranberry meet with thyme on the sip, where swirling flavors strive to find a centerline.",87,16,California
8530,US,"Blackberry and boysenberry flavors so ripe they seem sweet fill out this smooth, full-bodied wine. The texture is soft and not at all tannic, letting the potent fruit flavors flow easily through the finish.",87,16,California

8560,US,"Deep aromas of hibiscus, rose buds, dark red berries and sugar plums are spiced up by cola, crushed pencils and lots of garrigue on this bottling. The palate is clean and crisp, with snappy raspberry, light cranberry and lots more chaparral-like herbs, including wild thyme, bay laurel, lavender and fennel pollen.",93,48,California
8570,Austria,"The nose just gives a gentle hint of ripe apricot. The palate, on the other hand, speaks freely of zesty citrus: ripe lemon and fresh Seville orange, full of tart zestiness and refreshing zing. This is slender and linear, taut but chock-full of fruit. There is drive and energy and total refreshment.",93,65,Kamptal
8580,Portugal,"Fresh, despite the dense tannin, this is a ripe, juicy wine, full of black currant flavors and vibrant acidity. Wood treatment shows more cassis just at the end to round the wine out.",89,24,Douro
8590,Australia,"On the side, with a hint of warmth on the finish, this is nevertheless a very good wine. The aromas are powerfully mineral, accented by bold lime notes, while the flavors are intense and concentrated. Drink now.",89,17,South Australia
8600,Italy,"Almond, toast, vanilla bean and other oak-related aromas drive the nose of this vibrant Riserva from one of the most beautiful estates in Radda-in-Chianti. The wine has good harmony in the mouth where the natural fruit shines through and is powered by the wine's smooth structure and polished tannins.",89,,Tuscany
8610,Chile,"Cherry and black olive aromas are common for standard Chilean Cabernet, which this is. A fleshy, flush mouthfeel is raw due to prodding acidity and tannins. Herbal berry flavors are spicy and a touch green, while this tastes minty on the finish.",86,13,Chile

8690,Spain,"Jammy blueberry aromas are grapy, with ample char and grit coming from background oak. This feels firm, wiry, grabby and drying. Jammy, herbal flavors of cassis and blueberry finish with big, rubbery, elastic tannins.",88,19,Northern Spain
8700,France,"A perfumed, new wood-dominated wine, but one that does have the weight of fruit to support the wood. The tannins edge between fruit and wood, layered over rich black plums and bitter chocolate flavors. Under everything is fresh acidity to give the wine a welcome, vivid final lift.",88,20,Bordeaux
8710,South Africa,"Spicy, earthy, assertive…this wine has character. Toast, fruit, minerality and citrus on the palate gives it a fun feel, but the wine is seriously good. Excellent for seafood or more complex Asian cuisine.",88,38,Stellenbosch
8720,Chile,"A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.",88,15,Casablanca Valley
8730,US,"This shows good blackberry and black currant flavors, with the smooth, rich tannins for which Oakville is noted. But there's no particular intensity or ageworthiness. Drink up.",87,75,California
8740,US,"Earthy notes of clay and mushroom lend a rugged complexity to aromas of roasted plums and cherries on this lush yet composed wine. The palate is densely concentrated with black cherry flavor, but anchored with bright acidity and a blanket of velvet tannins.",89,25,New York
8750,France,"This is a heavily wooded wine, with tannins giving a firm and dry character at this stage. It has weight and a powerful structure, but needs time to develop riper fruit and plum flavors. It's always likely to show wood flavors, but certainly wait until 2017.",89,22,Southwest France
8760,Austria,"Great freshness and and almost grassy fruitiness join the yeasty autolytic notes. There is frothy liveliness and irrepressible fruit—red and green apple, a hint of pineapple and zesty lemon. This is one for those who prefer their sparklers full of fruit and life. Midpalate concentration makes this robust enough for food.",89,29,?sterreichischer Sekt
8770,US,"The addition of 9% Traminette lends a blossomy flair to fresh apple and tangerine notes in this bright, unoaked Chardonnay. Brisk and revitalizing, with a zesty lime-toned acidity, it's a satisfying late-summer quaffer at a bargain price.",89,11,New York
8780,US,"This Napa-side-of-Carneros Chardonnay is resplendent in crisp yet hearty aromas of apple, pear and flowery jasmine.

8800,Italy,"Aromas of dried tobacco leaf, oak and toast take the forefront, with prunes marinated in spirits and a whiff of farmyard hovering in the background. The palate shows muddled flavors of overripe black cherry, bitter dried sage, vanilla and espresso with notes of sweet-and-sour soy sauce alongside fleeting tannins.",87,,Tuscany
8810,Italy,"Aromas of mature black fruit, spearmint and espresso come with the barest whiff of earthy farmyard.

8830,Spain,"Highly concentrated black-fruit aromas of plum and currant are made more interesting by cola and forest-floor notes. This is a dense, chewy and almost fat Cabernet Sauvignon.

8880,US,"The mountain appellation speaks loudly in this wine, contributing juicy blackberry, tar and leather, all within a forested context of wild truffle and crunchy leaves.

8890,Italy,"From the Monforte d'Alba area of Barolo, this deeply concentrated and rich wine is etched by sharp aromas of licorice, black pepper, red cherry, chocolate, leather and cigar box. The mouthfeel, with its soft, velvety tannins, is particularly pleasurable. Drink after 2015.",93,74,Piedmont
8900,Italy,"Punset releases its wines much later than others and its organic, Nebbiolo-based wines really do need a lot of time in the bottle before they are ready to drink. Take this 2004 Barbaresco: The wine is very alive and bright with firm tannins and a long finish that will gain traction over the next decade.",93,,Piedmont
8910,US,"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber.

It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins.

9110,Italy,"Aromas of this brawny wine suggest black plum, berry, violet, leather and dill. Notes of licorice, tobacco and black pepper back up the sour cherry fruit. Big with round tannins, this is just reaching its ideal drinking window. Drink through 2019.",90,105,Piedmont
9120,Italy,"Initially a bit closed, this opens with aromas of leather, leafy underbrush, tilled soil, wild berry and a whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still primary, displaying red cherry, sage and menthol alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2018.",90,68,Piedmont
9130,Chile,"This racy, fresh, cool-vintage blend is a touch rubbery on the nose, with berry and cassis undertones. A tight palate delivers a mix of dark plum, blackberry, baking spice and chocolate flavors in front of a peppery, dry, crisp finish. Drink through 2019.",90,30,Colchagua Valley

9200,US,"An interesting wine by virtue of its oddball variety and the way it feels in the mouth. It's bone dry and quite high in acidity, giving it an ultra-clean mouthfeel framing citrus and mineral flavors that are a bit vegetal. Needs stimulating food, especially umami-dominated.",86,22,California
9210,Chile,"Fresh and colorful, with black cherry, cassis, sweet oak and coffee aromas. Feels big and grabby, with big tannins supporting blackberry and olive flavors. Sort of a rough ride but generous with the baked flavors and fruit content.",86,12,Rapel Valley

Yet the flavors are ripe and seductive, in peaches, pears, papayas, honeysuckle flowers and oak-influenced butter, honey and vanilla. Great with Thai food.",87,35,California
9230,US,"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much.",87,70,California
9240,France,"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin.

9260,France,Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.,91,28,Alsace

9360,Spain,"Big and sweet, with ripe berry aromas, candy and leather on the nose. This wine is a classic fruity joven; it's bulky and easygoing, with black cherry, raspberry and chocolate.

9370,Spain,"Everyone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour.

9380,US,"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose.

9400,Austria,"Slightly more advanced notes stand out: a herbal tinge of sun-warmed, wild thyme has crept into the citrus peel which utterly dominates the palate. This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness. On the aftertaste, herbal notes assert themselves again: dried tisane of verbena and dried apple punctuate with pleasant accents.",93,32,Wachau
9410,US,"A scent of burnt sugar hits the nose first, followed by blasts of papaya and kiwi. The palate tastes off-dry, and it offers a caramelized flavor. The wine clings to the palate on the finish, which gives it some length.",83,15,Virginia

9430,US,"Tastes like an old wine that Nonno brought up from the basement in a carafe. It's supposedly a Bordeaux blend, but it could be anything red and full-bodied.",82,30,California
9440,US,"Another tiny production, made in a different style from many of the other designates released by the producer this year, Ten Oaks is named for the, yes, 10 trees bordering the vineyard.

9480,US,"This notable Gewürtz starts with an aromatic, fresh fruit nose—melon, flowers—tinged with spice.

The wine offers complexity but is also fun and refreshing, not perfumy or heavy.",87,15,New York

Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling.",93,18,Washington
9610,US,"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",93,40,California
9620,France,"A solid wine from a fine vintage, this wine, a blend of local Gaillac grapes, is full, dense, firmly tannic. It has a juicy black fruit character that brings out the structure and the aging potential. The acidity at the end gives freshness and a lift. Drink from 2015.",93,,Southwest France
9630,US,"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour.",85,85,California

9690,Argentina,"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas.

9720,US,"Tingling acidity wraps around a core of pear and peach fruit in this well-integrated, layered and lush wine. The oak is quiet through the entry and midpalate, picking up power and weight on the finish. Lovely on its own, it's also a good choice for the table.",90,15,California

9780,France,"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5?? years' aging.",92,42,Burgundy
9790,Argentina,"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009??012.",92,112,Mendoza Province
9800,Portugal,"Long barrel-aging of many old native varieties gives this field blend a rich, ripe taste.

This unusual, impressive wine from the Guedes family is ready to drink now.",93,65,D?o
9810,US,"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop.",93,46,California

9890,US,"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens.",88,36,California
9900,France,"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025??050.",96,60,Alsace
9910,US,"Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 2019??030.",95,52,California
9920,France,"Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the C?te des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further.",95,150,Champagne
9930,Germany,"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish.",90,15,Rheingau
9940,US,"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",90,55,Washington
9950,US,"The first vintage from this estate vineyard, this is quite light, especially as the 2011 vintage was cool. It shows the delicate structure at which Pinot Noir excels. It's aromatic and varietal, very well made, and a good bottle for any roasted small bird such as squab or quail.",87,45,Oregon

9990,US,"Pretty sharp in tannins and acids, even for a Stags Leap Cab. Although it has plenty of blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, it's a hard wine. The palate finds so much to like, it wants it to be softer, but it's not, so the gamble is on aging. Try after 2013.",89,45,California
10000,France,"This is a smooth, ripe, and rounded wine that's intense on the palate with bright red-fruit flavors. Integrated acidity and hints of maturity add balance to rich fruitiness.

10010,Chile,"Even if there's an herbal leaning and some tomato to the nose, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Cab Franc is elegant and balanced. In the mouth, it's smooth and silky, while flavors of mocha, coffee and herbal berry fruits finish with fresh acidity and a sense of class. Drink through 2017.",91,61,Maule Valley
10020,France,"Very mineral in style, this is a structured, textured wine with good aging potential. It's acidity, still pronounced and up front, reveals itself with crisp citrus flavors that accent warm yellow fruits. The wine needs a year or two before drinking, so wait until 2015.",91,54,Burgundy

10050,South Africa,"The name certainly gives a clear indication of what to expect from this wine, with prominent herbal aromas and flavors of fresh mint, fynbos and licorice root that frame the blackberry and raspberry fruit core.

10080,Argentina,"Like most Colomé Malbecs, this is purple in color, with concentrated aromas of rubber, herbs and jammy blackberry. A thick, almost soupy palate is chewy and cushioned, while saturated black-fruit flavors finish heavy, jammy and on the cusp of overdone.",88,25,Other
10090,South Africa,"Decadent scents of buttered brioche, honeydew and crushed yellow flowers lead the nose, while flavors of grilled yellow peaches and orange oil flood the palate.

10150,Italy,"Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice. The evolved palate isn't in sync with the nose, offering raisin and a touch of anise as well as aggressive, astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, raspy finish. It's already drying out so drink now.",87,70,Piedmont
10160,Italy,"This offers aromas of oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean that carry over to the palate along with a hint of dried black cherry and a confectionary note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins give it an astringent finish.",87,,Piedmont

11320,US,"Woodspice and vanillin are out in front on the aromas followed by mocha, raspberry and dark fruit. The palate brings lush, concentrated flavors and a lingering finish. It drinks beautifully now sbut should have a long life ahead of it.",93,52,Washington
11330,US,"Blackberry, black cherry and blueberry aromas are cut by complex hints of dark chocolate and nutmeg on this Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. The tannins are quite firm on the palate, framing black plums, vanilla, caramel, dill and dried mint flavors. Drinking 2018??030 will allow more black cherry and blueberry character to evolve on the sip.",93,55,California
11340,France,"This estate has produced an impressive wine for the vintage. It balances acidity, tarry wood flavors and ripe black-berry fruits. Initially it is still showing its structure more than fruit, although this will even out as it matures. Drink from 2020.",93,,Bordeaux
11350,Argentina,"Pointed red-plum aromas are lemony and leathery. The palate is decidedly tomatoey and acidic, with flavors of plum skin, currant and pepper. An herbal, spicy, drying finish feels raw and tastes sour.",82,13,Mendoza Province
11360,US,"Everything about this wine is admirable except for the concentration. It's dry and crisp with acidity, but only delicately flavored with citrus, pears, honey and vanilla bean.",82,15,California
11370,US,"This Merlot seems designed for folks who like their red wines with residual sugar. It's soft and sugary, with raspberry jam and oak flavors.",81,8,California
11380,France,"Soft and rich, this is a fruity and textured wine. It has strong pear and spice flavors that complement the edge of lemon zest. This combination results in a wine that is bright and fruity. Screwcap.",87,15,Bordeaux
11390,France,"A ripe, juicy and forward wine, this is all fruit—but it's delicious fruit. The tannins are restrained behind the exuberant fruitiness. It may not be classic Bordeaux, but it is likely to be very drinkable in 2?? years.",87,35,Bordeaux
11400,France,"This Meynard family wine is ripe and soft with a smooth, creamy texture and a perfumed backdrop. It is ready to drink, full of good acidity and with a tangy, zesty texture. The aftertaste keeps that attractive perfumed character.",91,13,Bordeaux

11420,Portugal,"This is a beautiful lightly wood-aged wine. Made from arguably Portugal's greatest white grape, it is rich, smooth and balanced elegantly between toastiness and yellow fruits. The wine is still on the young side and will be better from spring 2018.",91,19,D?o
11430,Spain,"Oaky, inky aromas of blackberry and vanilla are pushy and potent. This blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Syrah is rubbery and pinched on the palate, while toasty, rooty flavors of black fruits blend with herbal berry and coffee notes. A narrow finish is herbal in flavor and weighty. Drink through 2020.",91,60,Northern Spain
11440,France,"Coming from high terraces above the River Lot, this wood-aged wine is cool, collected and stylish. It has ripe blackberry and currant fruits along with just the right amount of firm tannins. Acidity keeps everything fresh and fruity while guarding the structure. Drink from 2017.",91,30,Southwest France
11450,Italy,"Oak, toast, menthol and a whiff of purple flowers lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The concentrated palate delivers dried black cherry, chocolate, vanilla and dried sage alongside tightly-packed tannins. A clove note signals the finish.",91,59,Tuscany
11460,US,"Blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors abound in this dry, tannic Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows Napa Valley class, and with 6,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",87,20,California
11470,New Zealand,"The 2010 vintage of Te Kahu is 80% Merlot, with only single-digit percentages of the other varieties. It's a darkly fruited wine, with notes of black cherry and blackberry that are impeccably clean and precise. Drink this silky-textured, medium-bodied wine over the next five years.",87,22,Hawke's Bay
11480,US,"This rosé gets its pretty eye-of-the-partridge color from having undergone cold soaking. Dry, soft and subtle, it shows peach, vanilla and spice flavors. Great with cioppino or grilled salmon.",87,18,California
11490,Spain,"There are many things to love about this blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. To begin with, it's properly schisty and spicy on the nose, with mature, slightly herbal berry-fruit scents. This feels dynamic despite showing roasted flavors of red berry, pepper and wild herbs. For under $50, this delivers a lot of quality. Drink now??016.",92,46,Catalonia
11500,US,"Created by Joshua Klapper, the fine winemaker at La Fenetre, for Santa Monica's Fig Restaurant, this wine is balanced in alcohol and subtle, but complex in its array of fruits, spices, earth, oak, tannins and acids. If you're in the area, check it out.",92,34,California
11510,US,"Expensive, yes, but very fine, notable for a lovely structure and ripe, complex flavors that should develop in the cellar. It's dry, smoothly tannic and awesomely rich with blackberries and currants, and a gorgeous application of sweet new oak. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 10 years.",92,85,California
11520,Italy,"Nivole, a play on the Italian word for clouds, is a fresh and floral Moscato d'Asti with foamy bubbling and delicate aromas of soapy flowers, honey and sweet peach. Although this wine should normally be consumed very young, this vintage has held up beautifully and there's a touch of creamy mint on the close.",86,,Piedmont
11530,US,"Soft in the mouth, with a somewhat simple structure, this Syrah's main virtue is flavor. It's enormously rich in ripe blackberry- and cherry-pie filling, cola, licorice, mint, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors, and is fully dry.",86,26,California
11540,Italy,"Bricco Asili Bernardot opens with a pretty garnet color and luscious aromas of fruit, leather, road tar and spice. It's a sophisticated and masculine wine with rich vanilla and oak shadings in the background that add density and staying power. The tannins are hard as nails so either drink this Barbaresco now with succulent red beef, or better yet, wait five-plus years.",92,78,Piedmont
11550,US,"This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle. Tasted at the age of two, it's astringent and jammy, with pepper-infused blackberry and mulberry flavors and a gamy touch of smoked beef. Give it until mid-2009, when it will be fantastic with grilled beef.",92,25,California
11560,US,"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc shows prominent blue fruit aromas, with plum, mountain blueberry, herb and spice notes to round them out. The flavors are concentrated and texturally rich, providing a lot of appeal.",91,85,Washington

11580,Spain,"Creamy oak and raisiny notes announce ripeness and richness that turn to complexity as this Syrah airs out. In the mouth, this is full-force, with choppy tannins and tomato-like acidity. Spice, herb and plum flavors finish dry, toasty and well balanced. Drink through 2021.",91,,Northern Spain
11590,US,"Shows green, peppery flavors with a strong touch of gooseberry. The combination of acidity and ripe flavors tastes like a lemon candy cough drop. Good, but simple.",83,20,California
11600,US,"Has the silky weight and flavors of a nice Pinot Noir, with pleasant orange rind and sour-cherry candy notes. But there's a green scouriness that cuts through the palate like a sharp knife.",83,10,California
11610,Argentina,"Chunky berry and cured meat aromas turn sweaty and herbal with airing. In the mouth, this is wholly basic. Flavors of soupy, herbal berry fruits lack definition, while the finish deals molasses and peppery bitterness.",83,16,Mendoza Province
11620,US,"There's a funky, foxy note and a sour edge to this wine, which seems disjointed, or perhaps still showing a little bottle shock. Component flavors include sour plum and wild cherry, and the finish is leathery and tannic.",85,30,Oregon
11630,US,"Merlot needs more concentration than this in order to really shine as a stand-alone varietal wine. This is thin, green, and simply generic. Pomegranate fruit peeks through, quickly overlaid with weedy tannins.",85,25,Oregon
11640,France,"Made from the Négrette grape found in Fronton near Toulouse, this wine has a light structure to balance its dry acidity and citrus crispness. It's packed with clean, forward red currant fruit, ready to drink now.",85,11,France Other
11650,Chile,"Pencil eraser, blueberry, olive and peppery notes are what you draw off the bouquet of this ripe yet basic Cab. In the mouth, this feels rubbery and tannic.

11660,US,"This big, lusty Zin has high alcohol, which gives it a full bodied, glyceriney sweetness, as well as some heat. It's ripe in blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Great to drink now with barbecue.",87,24,California

11680,Spain,"Mild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.",87,20,Galicia
11690,Portugal,"Always attractive, this light and fruity wine is crisp with lemon acidity and tart green apples. There is an attractive tangy character that gives the wine extra freshness. Drink now.",86,9,Alentejano
11700,US,"This combines the sweet spiciness of oak with the apparent sweetness of the grapes in a full-bodied, extreme-flavored package. Aromas suggest charred wood, vanilla, maple syrup and cherry juice, while the flavor conveys blackberry jam.",86,42,California
11710,US,"Juicy with ripe tannins, it tastes lovingly hand-crafted, detailed and focused in black currant, berry and leather. Though rich and luxurious it retains ample natural acidity to buoy its way through a meal or through several years of aging.",90,40,California
11720,Germany,"Whiffs of blossom accent fresh apple aromas on this just off-dry Riesling. The palate is intensely fruity with ripe, rich apricot and white peach flavors yet cut with bristling lime acidity. Refreshing yet deeply satisfying.",90,31,Rheingau

11740,Spain,"Clean lines and fresh, oak-tinged aromas is what this Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is all about. The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull. A nice food wine and probably the best barrel-fermented white from Muga we've tried.",89,16,Northern Spain
11750,US,"From the original Kiona vineyard planting in 1975, this big, lush Chardonnay fills the palate with ripe banana and stone fruit flavors. It was barrel fermented, then moved to stainless, and put through partial malolactic. Good definition, acidity, and a hint of minerality.",89,19,Washington
11760,US,"This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch.",84,30,California

11800,US,"This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it.",86,22,California
11810,Chile,"Asphalt and spice aromas are herbal and gritty. This shows a moderately full body and solid structure along with plum and herbal flavors. A dry, peppery finish is slightly rubbery in feel but fresh.",86,13,Maule Valley

11850,US,"A decent everyday sipper. Soft and a little dull in texture, it's rich in blackberry, currant, chocolate and pecan pie flavors.",84,20,California
11860,Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.",84,12,Mendoza Province
11870,France,"Close to Epernay and on the cusp of the Chardonnay-dominated C?te des Blancs, this producer has Grand Cru holdings in the village of Chouilly. Those vines have produced a wine that balances mineral-laced fruit with a soft aftertaste. Young and with apple flavors, it's great now but will continue to develop in the cellar. Drink from 2018.",90,49,Champagne
11880,US,"This is sourced from a steep site on the southern end of the appellation, a sunny location that provides concentration and weight to the wine. Smoky, herbal and earthy, it offers a wealth of rounded tannin and approachable texture that's complemented by dark cherry, blackberry, clove and vanilla.",90,50,California
11890,US,"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense.",90,70,California
11900,France,"This ripe wine offers flavors of Williams pear and honey as well as citrus and herbal characteristics. It is full while cut with orange zest and spiciness. The wine is refreshing, sophisticated and likely to age well. Drink now and until 2020.",92,29,Loire Valley
11910,France,"Like the La Louvée, this wine is plummy and superripe, wrapped in toasty, cedary oak. It's savory as well, with meaty notes carried along by waves of richness. The finish is lined with mouthcoating tannins, suggesting a few years of cellaring are warranted. Drink 2018??030.",92,85,Rh?ne Valley
11920,France,"Highly reputed for its red wines, Vacheron continues to display its skills with this latest vintage. The wine is rich and full with a combination of bright red fruits and a firm, integrated structure. It is a fresh wine now and one that should age. Drink from 2018.",92,38,Loire Valley
11930,US,"This Cabernet Sauvingon includes 6% each Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It's herbal and austere, though not at all tricked up with vanilla flavor. Short and to the point, it's a good every day red for heartier meals.",85,15,Washington
11940,US,"A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, the Tavola Rosso is a wine that seems to be in search of a distinct identity. Tannic, drying and vanilla soaked, it has a red fruit flavor that vanishes all too quickly.",85,32,Washington
11950,France,"This is a structured wine, with dry tannins and notes of berry and red cherry. The fruit comes through the smoky character, bringing sweet-tasting acidity. Give this wine 3?? years to age.",85,15,Bordeaux
11960,Italy,"This ruby-colored Brunello opens with bright cherry nuances and loads of toasted almond and cinnamon spice. From the lower, southern side of Montalcino, this interpretation focuses on quality fruit aromas, crispness and a sense of clean linearity.",91,55,Tuscany
11970,Italy,"Bellezza is indeed a beautiful expression of Sangiovese (aged in oak) that peels back layer after layer with cherry, spice, leather and tobacco aromas. The fruit-driven finish is long, smooth and satisfying.",91,35,Tuscany
11980,US,"Comprised of 66% Zinfandel, 20% Barbera and 14% Primitivo. Brutocao has gone in a different direction than most of its 2010 Coro counterparts. It mixes in Barbera, presumably for acidity and freshness, to the bigger boned personalities of Zin and Primitivo. In the end, the fruit and acidity are dulled by the toffee and oak and grippy, grizzled leather in this wine.",85,40,California
11990,Portugal,"Firm and concentrated, it has dense tannins that bring out a bitter, chocolate edge. Wood gives a dark toast character. With all these conflicting elements, it's hard to see the wine's future.",85,15,Tejo
12000,US,"Dark gold in color, this very sweet dessert wine has intense flavors of apricot nectar, pineapple-infused crème br?lée, vanilla frosting and butterscotch. It's rich, but balanced with a squeeze of lime acidity.",92,30,California
12010,US,"Beautifully rich and ripe in cherries, raspberries and sweet smoky cedar, this Pinot is fully drinkable now, although decanting will help. But it's also an ager. Shows a mushroomy dryness and herbal grounding that suggest improvement through 2013.",92,50,California
12020,France,"A blend from grand cru vineyards in the top villages of the C?te des Blancs. This is Agrapart's base wine, but it is an impressive base, with its extreme minerality that demands food, its lime, kiwi and textured fruit skin flavors. It finishes with great depth and complexity.",92,35,Champagne
12030,Italy,"Aromas of coffee, espresso, toast, black plum, vanilla and berry fruit open this wine. The straightforward palate delivers rich black cherry accented with vanilla, chocolate and licorice alongside tight tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.",90,50,Piedmont

12050,US,"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",83,9,California
12060,Spain,"This smells of funk, yeast and cured meat. Tangy and acidic in the mouth, it has peach, citrus and ham flavors, finishing a bit mealy.",82,10,Northern Spain
12070,US,"This exudes funky aromas, suggesting sweaty leather. In the mouth it turns softly sweet and hot in alcohol.",82,27,California
12080,US,"The fruit that was used to make this Pinot Grigio was sourced from a High Valley vineyard situated at an elevation of 2,000 feet. The resulting wine is full of citrus and green apple aromas and flavors. The finish shows a touch of sweetness.",86,14,California
12090,US,"By “Old Vine Cabernet??the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight.",86,32,Washington
12100,Israel,"Bright and juicy, this wine offers upfront fruit aromas and flavors of blueberry, black cherry and plum. Hints of fudgy brownie and berry preserve add depth and decadence to the palate, and stay well into the medium-length finish. Drink now.",86,17,Galilee
12110,US,"Coming from the original plantings at this esteemed vineyard, this wine brings brooding, high-toned aromas of savory herbs, exotic spice and cherry. The palate is all about sophistication and delicacy of flavor, showing nuance and detail, particularly considering the warmth of the vintage.",90,72,Washington
12120,US,"Velvety blueberry and blackberry notes highlight the moderate structure of this blend of 35% Grenache and 32% Syrah with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Counoise. Lightly spiced with nutmeg and white pepper, it's balanced and food-friendly, with a soft, round texture.",90,38,California
12130,Portugal,"With creamy Encruzado and perfumed Malvasia in the blend, this is a deliciously full-bodied wine. There is a smoky character as well as a creamy texture. The wine is young and fruity but ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018.",90,14,D?o
12140,Canada,"Oculus is 71% Merlot, with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Cabernet Franc finishing the blend. As with Mission Hill's other high-end red blends, it's almost jet black in hue, with scents of smoke and char around blackberry and black cherry fruit. Chocolate and espresso flavors come through strongly, and the tannins are quite drying. It's a style ready-made for a thick, juicy steak.",91,120,British Columbia
12150,Spain,"Like all Alto Moncayo Garnachas, this opens with a big, loud crust of toasty oak and campfire smoke on top of blackberry aromas. The palate offers depth and body, while charred, toasty black-fruit flavors finish peppery and with tolerable heat. Drink through 2021.",91,35,Northern Spain
12160,US,"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish.",91,18,New York
12170,US,"Sweet and jammy in cherries, with hard, angular tannins and lots of acidity. The result is awkward, but pasta primavera will help.",84,32,California
12180,Italy,"There's not much pulp or grit here, but this easygoing (and well-priced) Chardonnay does offer distant aromas of stone fruit and honey. Citrus flavors and sharp acidity best describe the mouthfeel.",84,10,Veneto
12190,Italy,"This is a strange wine from Puglia, in Southern Italy, with drying aromas of crushed hazelnut and Graham cracker. You'll get peanut butter and almond cookies as well and the fruit aromas resemble prunes and raisins. The blend is 40% Uva di Troia, 40% Montepulciano and 20% Aglianico.",84,12,Southern Italy
12200,US,"Shades of earth and mineral take center stage in this dry, refreshing Pinot Noir rosé. It's delicately concentrated, just barely kissed by tart red cherry and strawberry flavors, but a zesty, fresh summer pick-me-up.",86,15,New York
12210,Italy,"Initially shy on the nose, this eventually opens up in the glass to reveal dried yellow fruit, toast, chamomile flower and a whiff of sage. The palate offers toasted oak, walnut and a buttery note, but it lacks fruit richness.",86,21,Tuscany
12220,New Zealand,"Gibbston Valley is one of the coolest parts of Central Otago, so its fruit is often blended with that from other regions. This medium-bodied wine is all Gibbston—tart, wiry and herbal, with pie cherry fruit and lemony acids on the finish. Despite all that, the tannins are nicely ripe.",86,60,Central Otago
12230,US,"Here's a rich, round Chard that delivers with its ripe, mouth-filling flavors. White peach, papaya, spicy fig, smoke, buttered toast, vanilla are accompanied by crisp, clean acidity. The intense finish lasts for a long time.",91,30,California

12250,US,"A bit on the lean side, with apple and citrus flavors, which are typical of the appellation. Acidity is also sharp and mouth-watering. This is not a big, fat Chardonnay but it is a well-structured, foodworthy wine, with oaky influences. This tight structure is very clean.",90,38,California
12260,US,"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados.",92,28,California
12270,US,"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.",91,26,California
12280,South Africa,"Fat-bodied but tangy, with grapefruit and lime aromas and flavors. A touch of figginess and a tangerine note on the palate balance the flavor profile. There's lovely texture—quite full for Sauvignon Blanc—and a long ripe finish.",90,15,Groenekloof

12340,US,"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",88,58,California
12350,US,"Deep ruby pink in color, this wine begins with a nuanced nose, mixing the fun of grape soda with the elegance of purple flowers. On the palate, it's a tad boozy for pink wine, but the flavors of cherry and currant stand out in front of the alcohol. It would make a nice companion for a dish with ample flavors and actual warmth, such as chicken soup or a tuna melt.",88,28,California
12360,France,"Smoky flavors go with dry tannins to give this wine a solid structure. It is dry at the back, allowing room for the acidity and black currant fruits to come forward. Drink from 2016.",85,20,Bordeaux

12420,Croatia,"Though aromatically subdued, there's an intensity of tangerine and lime zest flavor in this dry, invigorating Malvasia. The midpalate is marked by elegant white-flower notes that linger on the slightly astringent lime-pith finish.",87,16,Istria
12430,US,"Fenestra, an estimable producer of obscure Spanish and Portugese varieties in California, does not disappoint with this Verdelho. Like a just-ripe pineapple, the wine is high in acidity and savory in strong tones of lemon and lime. Clean and fresh, it pairs well with seafood.",87,16,California
12440,France,"This 50-50 blend of Picpoul Blanc and Roussanne is ripe and fleshy, boasting round notes of melon, peach, pineapple and lemon custard. There's a soft, herbal accent of white flower and citrus zest that graces the lively finish. Drink now.",87,14,Languedoc-Roussillon
12450,US,"Rich orange, lemon and citrus spices lead this Viognier from Page Springs. On the palate, it's fuller bodied, with lots of spice and citrus to balance out the honeyed fruit. Pair with cheese, fruit and spicy cuisine.",84,30,Arizona
12460,US,"A tough wine to like. Mourvèdre needs warmth, and this wine appears to have lacked enough of it to ripen. Shows an earthy, green herb and mint tug to the sweet oak and cherries. Drink now.",84,30,California
12470,Italy,"An easygoing Nero d'Avola, this shows characteristic almond and toasted pistachio flavors, followed by bright cherry and raspberry notes. The mouthfeel is tight and compact.",86,,Sicily & Sardinia
12480,Chile,"This is an herbal, almost throwback style of Carmenère. The nose delivers a blast of tomato leaf along with a rooty, herbal aroma of red fruit suggestive of pizza. The palate is tight and smacks hard with tannins, while the core flavors are roasted and burnt, with a baked berry note and an earthy nuttiness.",86,26,Maipo Valley
12490,US,"This G-S-M blend is solid and flavorful, with mixed berry flavors and an underpinning of graphite. The tannins are drying, on the edge of being chalky.",86,21,Oregon
12500,US,Fresh herbs and green florals are fresh and fragrant on the nose of this semidry Riesling. Subtly sweet flavors of hibiscus nectar and peach gain complexity with whiffs of freshly ground white pepper and an elegant dusting of chalk on the finish.,86,15,New York
12510,Italy,"A cheerful blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Cappuccio, Calìo would pair well with potato gnocchi with butter and chopped sage. Cherry, wild berry and almond are backed by a powerful but smooth mouthfeel.",86,,Sicily & Sardinia
12520,Spain,"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.",86,13,Northern Spain
12530,Germany,"While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.",88,101,Mosel
12540,US,"Fresh and approachable, this is a light, flowery expression of the variety, sourced from the Russian River no less, that's dry and flavored in fennel, apricot and apple. Medium in terms of weight and body, it finishes refreshingly.",88,25,California
12550,US,"Three months in stainless steel result in a very pale wine with aromas of lemon peel and grapefruit flesh. The palate is painted with bright, citrus zest acidity throughout, yet retains the varietal's flavors of nectarine flesh and yellow melons. It makes a leading option for the unoaked crowd.",88,22,California
12560,US,"A juicy wine certain to please those who opt for the hip label, this is quite showy on the nose, with densely packed blackberries, clove, caramel and vanilla elements. The rich palate is equally poppy and boisterous, with black cherry jam, allspice and nutmeg notes.",87,19,California
12570,US,"Aromas of black pepper are prominent and are followed by notes of dark plum that display purity. The palate is reserved in style, yet the fruit tones linger on the finish. It's hard to place the variety but it still brings plenty of appeal.",87,35,Washington
12580,Austria,"Summer blossom, honeysuckle, even rose petals appear on the aromatic nose. The slight and slender palate is poised and comes on very light feet. This is a breezy, easy summer wine to be drunk as soon as possible.",87,24,Südsteiermark
12590,Spain,"Jammy berrry, raisin and licorice aromas lead to a chewy, somewhat raisiny palate with prune, blackberry and herbal flavors. A mild-tasting finish with raisiny chunkiness and herbal notes is consistent with the nose and palate. This is good for under $10 despite being very ripe.",86,9,Levante
12600,Argentina,"This Tempranillo is a heavy, saturated number with rubbery plum and berry aromas. It's totally Argentinean in style and shares little to nothing with Spanish versions; it's full bodied but not showing much in the midpalate, while generic berry flavors offer chocolate notes and finish short.",86,19,Mendoza Province
12610,Spain,"Tobacco, dill and vanilla aromas transition to cherry and raspberry scents. The high-acid, cutting palate contains tart raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors that maintain through the finish. From a rough vintage, this wine is not excelling.",86,45,Northern Spain
12620,France,"87-89 Barrel sample. Firm, ripe, densely structured, giving what is almost a meal in itself. The texture is dry, also rich, powerful.",88,,Bordeaux
12630,US,"At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years.",88,28,California
12640,US,"Dark cherry and black licorice flavors combine in this wine from a 1,650-feet-elevation, estate-grown site. Moderate acidity buoys the fruit's ripeness and concentration, structured with firm, tight tannins.",90,42,California
12650,Austria,"Reduced when first opened, this wine shows its lemony, fresh apple notes with a bit of air. It has the lovely midpalate texture and freshness inherent to good Chardonnay and fills the mouth with citrus and orchard fruit notes. Slender, structured and fresh-faced, it only needs some time to breathe.",90,15,Burgenland
12660,France,"With a high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend, the wine is structured and finely perfumed. It has some firm tannins that are well integrated into the red-berries. While the wine is richly textured, it is also bursting with fruit at the end. Drink from 2018.",90,,Provence
12670,Uruguay,"Brambly and stalky berry fruit aromas come with citrus and leafy accents. The palate is sheer and tannic, with candied, spiced, red fruit flavors. Heat and burning acidity make the finish rather rough.",83,20,San Jose
12680,France,"Starts off with slightly confectionary cherry fruit, accented by peppery spice aromas and flavors. The structure is extremely soft, definitely making it a drink-now sort of wine.",83,17,Rh?ne Valley
12690,US,"This rarely seen variety (a hybrid from a cross of a French grape with an indigenous North American one) brings notes of ash, green olive and an assortment of berries. It's medium bodied with a low-alcohol feel and cranberry-like tartness.",84,28,Oregon
12700,US,"A soft, basic Cabernet, it offers meaty cinnamon and berry-plum flavors.",84,13,California
12710,US,"An easygoing, casual wine with melon and marshmallow flavors and a soft texture. It's cleanly made, light on the palate and almost sweet going down.",84,11,California
12720,US,"This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip.",88,20,California
12730,US,"Made in large quantities, this is juicy and complex, offering soft, leathery layers of mocha and blackberry, with plenty of oomph and body to please a variety of palates. Approachable and easy to enjoy, the tannins are firm and the finish brief.",88,24,California
12740,Portugal,"Everything is in place in this structured wine that's packed with big berry fruits that give a delicious succulence. At the same time, the tannins offer richness and concentration. It's almost ready to drink.",88,12,Tejo
12750,France,"Crisply fruity, herbaceous and citric, with lemon zest and fine pineapple. The wine's acidity should soften in a year.",85,17,Bordeaux
12760,Spain,"Cassis, raisin, vanilla and rooty spice aromas give this Tempranillo blend some class on the bouquet. It's resiny and fairly heavy feeling, with lightly burnt and earthy flavors of herbal red berry and plum. Dry and peppery on the finish.",85,8,Central Spain

12790,US,"A bracing, tart Riesling, quite dry and still under 13% alcohol, this mixes green apples, fresh citrus, pineapple and unusual suggestions of clove and spice. It's a fine follow-up to the winery's excellent 2007 bottling, though perhaps not quite as concentrated.",90,16,Oregon
12800,US,"A shock of sour cherry and pink grapefruit flavors penetrates through this revitalizing dry rosé. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Gamay and Pinot Noir, it carries out a fine balancing act between fruit forwardness and elegance.",88,16,New York
12810,US,"Soft in classic layers of cinnamon and clove, this wine is almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with a wealth of black plum and blackberry constituting its inner soul. The finish lingers in black pepper and more of that opening spice.",88,65,California
12820,US,"A generous expression of full-bodied fruit and oak, this wine is ripe in black cherry, plum and black licorice, robust and flavorful. The finish offers integrated tannins with a hint of cinnamon spice.",88,70,California
12830,Italy,"Alluring scents of wild berry, moist earth, truffle and grilled herb unfold in the glass. The vibrant, light-bodied palate offers juicy red cherry, chopped mint and star anise alongside lithe, polished tannins and bright acidity.",88,16,Tuscany
12840,US,"This refreshing sparkling wine made mostly from Pinot Noir grapes has a light-gold color and slightly toasted or earthy aromas. It feels lively and frothy in texture, nicely crisp in balance, and medium bodied. Ripe apple and peach flavors emerge with each sip.",88,41,California
12850,Italy,"Aromas of French oak, toast and spiced blueberry lead the nose. Showing the challenges of the cool, wet vintage, this is leaner than previous years but still offers wild cherry, coffee bean and anise alongside bright acidity and polished if not very persistent tannins. All in all an impressive effort for 2014. Drink soon.",88,28,Tuscany
12860,Portugal,"Toffee and vanilla aromas give an intensely sweet, molasses and caramel flavored wine in an almost syrup-like consistency. It is very ripe, with some honey, balanced with a surprisingly fresh citrus character.",91,125,Port

12880,US,"It's labeled Viognier, but the blend includes 20% Roussanne and a bit of Marsanne as well. It works terrifically, yielding a wine with a spicy mix of grapefruit, citrus rind, and Asian pear. Wonderful mouthfeel, with cut, focus and length.",91,20,Washington
12890,US,"This is a big, tannic, midnight black Cabernet, rude in youth and barely drinkable. The tannins are powerful enough to lock down the palate. The grapes, grown in Calistoga, are very ripe in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, but those tannins are stubbornly astringent. Almost old-fashioned in toughness despite very high alcohol, it's a curiosity that seems likely to develop in the cellar, but with so little evidence of past vintages, all bets are off.",91,125,California
12900,Italy,"Burdese is Sicily's tip-of-the-hat to the great wines of Bordeaux. A blended red, the wine is elegant and firm, with dark concentration and earthy tones of leather and spice behind fresh berry and blackberry. Balance and length characterize the mouthfeel.",91,42,Sicily & Sardinia
12910,France,"91??3. Barrel sample. A finely tannic wine, this is the second vintage release since Ch?teau Haut-Brion's owner took over and renamed the estate. The wine is darkly textured, very firm and concentrated with great Merlot character. The finish reveals delicious blackberry flavors.",92,,Bordeaux
12920,Portugal,"A full, yet fresh wine, with considerable acidity as well as tight black-currant fruit and a firm core of dry tannins. As it opens, the tannins strengthen, yielding a wine that has power as well as fruitiness.",91,,Port
12930,US,"This is a beautiful Riesling. It's not totally dry, like the label says, because there's a vein of honey that enriches the orange, apricot and white flower flavors, and persists into the finish. The acidity is ample, and there's a minerality that suggests steel and stones.",91,24,California
12940,US,"A powerfully rich and concentrated Bordeaux-style blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of four other Bordeaux varieties, this wine presents itself as juicy and fresh on entry, with high-toned sparks of cranberry, cherry and cassis. It takes on more strength and structure as it opens, suggesting its worth for the cellar. Hold until 2023??028.",94,175,California
12950,US,"This is a lovely, full-bodied wine from a historic vineyard site on Westside Road. Bready and brambly, it offers a juicy, exuberant palate that's rich and layered in blackberry, coffee and a persistent backdrop of white pepper. It's structured and balanced, with a deft twist of dusty dried herb.",94,58,California
12960,US,"It's a good thing Garagiste Festival cofounder Stewart McLennan caught the winemaking bug. This delicious bottling shows black currant, plum, blueberry, fennel, lavender, vanilla and gingerbread spice on the nose. Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla.",94,55,California

12990,Chile,"Hailing from the interior Maipo Valley, this SB is oily up front, with an aromatic note of gooseberry and lime. A round mouthfeel matches the nose, while pithy lime and white grapefruit flavors finish melony and oddly honeyed.",84,11,Maipo Valley
13000,US,"This medium-bodied Bordeaux blend features deep spice, pepper and red cherry flavors. It's a soft wine with gentle tannins and a subtle overall character.",82,43,New York
13010,US,"This Mourvèdre/Grenache/Petite Sirah blend offers appealing aromas and flavors of spicy berry and smoke, with good structure and length. The smoky character borders on excessive, though, so pair it with some grilled, spicy ribs or kebabs for the best experience.",82,20,Arizona
13020,US,"Soft and semisweet, this simple wine has sugary cherry juice flavors. It contains 18% Syrah.",81,16,California
13030,US,"Chimney Rock continues a successful string of vintages with this powerful '05. It's a distinguished wine that calls to mind the description of Stags Leap Cabernet as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Rich and full-bodied, it has lush flavors of black currants and smoky new oak. Easy to find, with 28,000 cases produced. Drink now through 2012.",92,58,California
13040,US,"Give this crisp young wine some time in a decanter, and it gets better as it warms up in the glass, evolving from being tight, acidic and closed to offering exotic flavors of raspberry jam, tangerine zest and baked cherry pie, complete with the smoky-sweet crust. Best now and through 2010.",91,48,California
13050,US,"Cola spice dominates the nose of this thick, concentrated wine from the heart of Westside Road. Stemmy earth notes accompany its ripe red fruit, as toasted oak and vanilla flavors extend long into the finish.",90,85,California
13060,US,"Nicely integrated, this large production wine is a fantastic deal for the quality, delivering layers of apple and Meyer lemon flavors within a frame of juicy acidity and balanced oak. A tease of nutmeg-dusted apricot lingers on the finish.",90,20,California
13070,US,"This bright, light and acid-driven wine is juicy and fresh—a full embrace of tart lemon and tangerine flavors. Its liveliness is long-lived and welcome.",90,29,California
13080,US,"This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too.",85,40,California
13090,Peru,"Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.",85,15,Ica
13100,Chile,"Solid from front to back. The nose is your normal mix of cassis, blackberry, latex glove and licorice nibs, while the palate runs hard and condensed, with ripe black fruit flavors. A little clacky and tough on the tongue and cheeks, but true as you can ask for from a Colchagua Cabernet.",89,20,Colchagua Valley
13110,Italy,"With fruit sourced from Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive, this elegant wine will surprise you with its aromatic intensity.

Subtle shades of licorice, prune and tobacco appear in the background and the wine is bright, firm and enduring in the mouth.",89,50,Piedmont
13120,France,"In the ongoing debate about how well Muscadet can age, this wine gives a good answer: yes it can. There is no sign of the fruit declining; in fact it seems to have become richer and fuller. The texture has softened to give a smooth, creamy wine that is still bright, although very ready to drink.",89,14,Loire Valley

13140,US,"A fresh, grassy aroma and lively grapefruit and herb flavors give a lot of zest to this medium-bodied and almost peppery wine.",89,16,California
13150,US,"A strongly flavored, sugary, unsubtle wine, leaving little to the imagination. Swamps the mouth with ripe, jammy flavors of pineapples, apricots, mangoes, limes, kiwi fruit and honey.",84,22,California
13160,Italy,"This easy-drinking blended red wine opens with offbeat aromas of banana, mixed fruit salad and sour cherry. With more time in the glass, those bright fruit aromas are slowly replaced by spice and almond flavors.",83,15,Veneto
13170,Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Mammolo, this straightforward wine opens with aromas that recall plum cake, ripe black fruit and a hint of balsam. The juicy palate offers crushed black cherry accented with cinnamon. Drink now to capture the succulent fruit and freshness.",87,22,Tuscany
13180,Chile,"This is a woody blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan, which is not a common mixing in Chile.

13300,US,"This crisp, lively and dry rosé is made from Mourvèdre and Grenache grapes. it shows great acidity and a rather lean and thirst-quenching texture that carries the vibrant raspberry and apple flavors right along.

13320,Spain,"On first take, this smells ripe and raisiny, with accents of marzipan, cigar box and baked berries. The palate is blocky in feel, with big tannins and a sense of richness.

13340,US,"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes. It's lightly spiked with sweet baking spices, and makes a perfectly delicious choice while waiting for some of the winery's bigger, bolder 2012s to age a bit further.",90,85,Oregon
13350,Italy,"This is a dense, thickly extracted Vino Nobile with aromas that recall new fruit—fresh, red cherry and ripe blueberry—and new wood, such as vanilla and carpentry shavings.

It's easy and very fruity in the mouth.",85,27,Tuscany
13360,Italy,"This Sangiovese-Syrah blend is the wine equivalent of a teenager that boasts youthful appeal. It has a solid core of fresh red fruit, especially cherries and blueberries.

13440,Chile,"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,82,Apalta
13450,Chile,"Not often do you find blends of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère. And it's been a while (1999) since we last tasted it; this version is ripe, a bit hard and very, very serious.

13580,New Zealand,"At the risk of overgeneralizing, Martinborough Sauvignons typically show less overt herbal characters than their Marlborough counterparts.

13700,US,"This is a very good dry Gewürztraminer that's laden in jasmine and honey, extremely perfumed on the nose, and light and crisp on the palate. With a suggestion of vanilla on the finish, it's a balanced white, ready to be enjoyed with a salad dressed with figs and goat cheese.",90,24,California
13710,Austria,"It is white pepper rather than fruit that pervades the nose and palate on this wine, displaying a tight grip and slender body—not to say that deeper berry fruit does not slumber in the depths.

16060,US,"The deep orange-gold color makes this wine look like a late-harvest version, and fragrant floral and apricot aromas continue that impression.

16140,US,"Made from Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this wine aims for the fences and largely succeeds.

It will probably pick up bottle nuances in a few years, but why wait?",93,85,California
16150,US,"Pure, almost crystalline in its expression of fruit, this 100% Malbec captures the essence of mountain berries. Juicy and perfectly balanced, it suggests a range of notes from tangerine to blueberry to wild raspberry, with lightly peppery, fine-grained tannins.",92,25,Washington
16160,US,"A concentrated white peach element plays strongly on the nose of this coveted bottling, with touches of sea salt and a sharp tangerine-like edge.

16290,Spain,"Leesy on the nose like the name implies, this Godello smells creamy, with notes of apple and melon. The palate shows moderate citric acidity but nothing scouring, while flavors of ripe apple, orange and powdered sugar finish leesy and peachy.",87,20,Northern Spain
16300,France,"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix.

16370,France,"A blend from different parts of the Fleurie appellation, this wine is elegant and floral. Crisp red fruits are sustained by acidity and by a juicy character. As often with this appellation, it is a wine to age and will be better from 2018.",92,20,Beaujolais

16450,France,"Plenty of tannins give this wine a firm and dense structure, but it also shows the potential of black-currant fruit flavors and perfumed acidity.

Right out of the bottle, it's tough as nails, but a bit of breathing softens it, bringing out a vast core of sweet black currant. Lots of new oak adds to the sweetness in the form of buttered toast. Should age well, if you're in the mood to cellar it, through 2017 or so.",92,80,California

16760,South Africa,"Winemaker: Jacques Borman. There's a ton of herbal, earthy tea-like tones to the nose of this wine, supported by notes of black plum, cherry and currant. The palate is smooth upon entry, with satiny tannins and plush, ripe fruit flavors that finish rich and spicy. It's delicious and decadent, though the complexity reigns on the nose as opposed to the palate. It's accessible now, but should hold well through 2022.",90,,Stellenbosch

16840,US,"The nose of smoke and sweet creamed corn doesn't exactly reel you in. Then a vegetal palate featuring mostly green beans and toasty oak is way off the mark, given the variety we're talking about. The finish is heavy, mouth coating and mildly bitter.",82,18,California
16850,US,"Incredibly rich, with ripe cherry, plum, spice and herb notes at the fore. It's all framed in luscious, broad tannins that are firm but velvety. Long on the finish.",93,32,California
16860,US,"Seems very oaky, with in-your-face aromas of vanilla, char and pepper, but the fruit is able to support it. In fact, the underlying flavors are rich and gorgeous. It shows Cabernet's cassis and blackberry aromatics, with the soft tannins and velvety, drink-me-now texture of Merlot.",92,24,California
16870,US,"Light and toasty, this is a pleasant, entry-level red wine with just a hint of chocolate in the finish. It's smooth and generic, but adds some spice and flesh once it's in the glass.",85,28,Washington
16880,Spain,"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",85,12,Northern Spain
16890,US,An unusual tawny color blends with deep pink in this wine that conveys cinnamon aromas and persimmon flavors. It's certainly an unusual style but has its own appeal.,85,15,California
16900,Italy,This offers subtle aromas of wild spring flowers and stone fruits. The lean palate suggests Bartlett pear and unripe white peach alongside brisk acidity.,85,18,Southern Italy

16930,US,"There's something rustic about this Cab. Partly it's the tannins, which are fierce. Partly it's the alcohol, which sticks out and gives the wine a burn. Yet it's extraordinarily ripe and opulent in black currants, with the liqueur headiness of crème de cassis. The hot alcohol suggests it will not age.",86,125,California
16940,US,"With ripe, jammy blackberry and plum flavors, gently touched with smoky oak, this is a nice Cab for drinking now. Smooth and silky, the tannins will work well against grilled beef.",86,20,California

16960,US,"Polished and varietal, this shows the skills of winemaker Chuck Reininger. The 2006 vintage produced tight, hard-edged, herbal wines, ageworthy but unyielding. But here it has been honed and softened, so that its Bordeaux-like traits are emphasized, with plenty of herbal character and spicy purple fruits. Still coming out of its shell, this is a wine to cellar and drink with a big, grilled steak.",90,38,Washington
16970,US,"Jammy blackberry and cherry fruit flavors mark this wine, along with some strong tannins. It's not particularly complex, and doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink up.",84,42,California
16980,Argentina,"Aromas of banana, tropical fruits and spun sugar set up a weighty, citrusy palate with flavors of fresh-squeezed orange juice and grapefruit. Fruity from front to back.",84,12,Mendoza Province
16990,France,"Chardonnay from the Loire spotlights the grape at its freshest. This lightly vanilla flavored wine is dominated by apple and pear flavors. The smooth texture is pierced with tight, mineral acidity that makes the wine so fruity and crisp. Drink now and until 2017.",84,,Loire Valley
17000,US,"This is a massive, powerful Chardonnay, a New World style that's superripe and heavily oaked. You either like it or you don't. Aficionados of this approach will love the opulence of the honey, pineapple jam, apricot, crème br?lée, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Calls for very rich dishes, like lobster.",92,40,California
17010,US,"Brandborg really knocks it out of the park with this Gewürztraminer, the strongest in a very solid lineup of white wines. It perfectly captures the oily, floral essence of the grape, in a dense, focused wine loaded with citrus oil, Key lime, and tropical fruits. Great length and balance, as with all the Brandborg white wines.",92,16,Oregon
17020,Austria,"Crisp, crunchy apple and pear fruit appears first. This is followed by both more generous apple juice and tarter citrus notes. The midpalate shows concentration and some gentle but determined power. Texture and acidity lend structure to a wine that feels weightier than it is. Wonderfully balanced and dangerously moreish.",91,20,Wiener Gemischter Satz
17030,US,"Coming from an up-and-coming region of the valley, this wine is direct in its appeal, with opulent aromas of dark plum, grape gummy, peppery spices and an herbal top note. The flavors are broad and pure, showing a deft touch. Coffee flavors linger on the finish.",90,44,Washington
17040,US,"Steve Clifton takes this common grape on an uncommonly tasty spin, starting with taut and fresh aromas of green-apple flesh, grapefruit pith and light white flowers.

17050,Italy,"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually gives up aromas of toasted walnut, citrus and crushed rock. The lean palate offers lime, raw yellow peach and a mineral note accompanied by bracing acidity.",85,17,Northeastern Italy
17060,US,"This is a dry, tannic estate wine that's rich and ripe with a leathery aspect of gun smoke and blackberry. It shows more in the way of black fruit and spicy pepper than fruit that's delicate or crisp.",85,60,California
17070,Portugal,"Fine ripe fruit pushes through the young tannic structure in this fresh wine. It still has an edge of tannin which balances well with the red berry fruits. Acidity cuts through everything to leave a crisp, blueberry flavored aftertaste.",85,10,Douro
17080,US,"Lushly scented with fresh-cut wood, red berries, cherries and toasted coconut, this delicately entwines the flavors that follow. It's a gentle, lovely, graceful and low-alcohol beauty that should continue to drink well into the mid-2020's.",92,42,Oregon
17090,Australia,"Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now??022.",92,42,Victoria
17100,US,"Concentrated violets, cherry blossoms and cola aromas show on this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri (who works in the cellar of friend Joey Tensley) that gets 5% Viognier added to the mix. Flavors are dense and broadly approachable, with blackberries, black cherries and purple flower elements.",92,50,California
17110,US,"A complex blend of 76% Zinfandel, 13% Petite Sirah, 6% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this opens with hints of raisins and Ruby Port, a reflection of the near-16% alcohol. But the wine is neither jammy nor hot, and the flavors bring concentrated raspberry and cherry compote, surprising acidity, and some intense herbal and stem highlights. All in all a big, chunky, potent wine that captures the distinctive style of this unique mini-micro winery.",88,25,Washington
17120,Spain,"This is dark as night, with boysenberry, blackberry, animal fur and smooth oak aromas. For $10, it's bringing all sorts of power and quality, like oak-influenced flavors of vanilla, chocolate, blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is full and smacks down with tannic grab.",88,10,Northern Spain
17130,US,"A very nice interpretation of Dry Creek Zin, this is full bodied, rich in alcohol and briary. It shows ripe flavors of berries, currants, anise and spices, wrapped into firm tannins, and finishing with hints of caramel.",87,24,California

17190,France,"Pegau's rare white Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape is a blend of 60% Clairette, 20% Grenache Blanc, 10% Roussanne and 10% Bourboulenc. Despite being full bodied and viscous on the palate, there's no sense of heaviness—the wine's aromas and flavors of barely ripe melon, anise and honeyed citrus seem to float on the palate, ending in a mouthwatering finish.",89,70,Rh?ne Valley
17200,France,"This is a wood-aged wine that has some weight. There's a strong toast character from the wood, contrasting with the ripe plum flavor.",86,,Alsace
17210,Spain,"Peachy, crisp aromas are mild but standard. It feels puckery and tight, with some spritz. Flavors of tangerine, orange and lemon are tangy but not sour, while the finish is long and chalky in feel. Drink immediately.",86,20,Northern Spain
17220,Spain,"Apple and mineral aromas are solid and fresh but don't deliver much kick. This feels lively, with a mix of citrus flavors that are enhanced by grass and a pithy finish. It ends on a green note, with a hint of scallion and a cut of acidity.",86,12,Northern Spain

17260,US,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla. Could be a little more focused and intense, but very fine, although it calls for a certain appreciation of this oxidative quality.",89,130,California
17270,US,"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility.

It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",89,35,Oregon
17280,US,"This shows the streamlined acidity and minerality of a fine coastal Chardonnay, as well as the dryness. But the ripeness is impressive, suggesting notes of Key lime pie, lemon meringue and ripe, sweet kiwi, with subtle oak influence. An impressive wine from start to finish.",94,45,California
17290,France,"It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century.

17400,US,"Another attempt at a low-impact Chardonnay unfettered by oak, this result is curiously confectionary and sweet. Apple flavors veer into candy territory and the wine is slightly fat instead of crisp, despite the low alcohol and stainless-steel fermentation.",84,14,California
17410,US,"With grapes sourced 60% from Sonoma County and 40% from Mendocino County, this is a soft, floral wine with a bright finish. A sister brand made by Martin Ray, it's priced affordably and will offer a pleasant experience for most palates.",84,18,California

17430,US,"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads.

With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",87,15,California
17440,US,"The appellation is in San Benito County, a terroir that has plenty of coastal influence.

Try as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Viognier.",87,20,California
17450,Germany,"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development. It's stony and layered with honeyed citrus without being sweet, with a wiry feel to the lingering finish. Drink now.",88,15,Rheingau
17460,US,"Tremendously sweet in blackberry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, with a fine bite of acidity. It's a satisfying dessert wine for drinking with chocolate, or try pecan pie, but it would score far higher if it were richer.",88,32,California

17530,US,"Stiff, tannic, earthy and wrapped up tight. It's a big, bruiser of a wine, oaky, earthy and showing liquorous barrel flavors. Tasted three times over a four month period, it remains quite tight and hidden; the fruit is there but it's very difficult to get this wine to open up. In time, therating could significantly improve.",89,45,Washington

17570,US,"Fresh-pressed blackberry juice meets with thyme and pencil lead on the nose of this very decent wine for the price.

17580,Greece,"Allspice and plum aromas are followed by flavors of vanilla, dark cherry, smoke and cocoa in this young but friendly red from the north. Fine tannins and an elegant herbal finish give the wine finesse. A good entree into Greek reds for myriad palates.",87,14,Drama

17690,France,This structured wine is slow to show its fruity side although it has a layer of acidity with hints of black fruits. It is firm and dry at the moment with dense tannins and a dark aftertaste. Wait until 2017.,84,16,Bordeaux

19080,Germany,"Intensely smoky, dusty mineral aromas on this Riesling dissipate with aeration to reveal a delightful bouquet of white blossoms and stonefruit. The palate is bright with citrus acidity and sweet yellow cherries. While lively and fresh now, it should develop remarkable complexity over the next 5?? years.",91,50,Mosel
19090,Italy,"This straightforward Barolo offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of dried rose petal, forest floor and ripe cherry. The palate delivers bright cherry and berry flavors, with hints of balsamic herbs and a subtle layer of carob. This is still young and tannic, but has surprising freshness for the vintage. Drink after 2015.",91,75,Piedmont
19100,US,"This was barrel fermented, and picked up a fair amount of oaky flavor as a result. The barrels overtake the light apple fruit, at least for now, but consider this as a fine, inexpensive alternative to Chardonnay.",87,16,Oregon
19110,US,"Blackberry, cedar, peppercorn and herb aromas come through on the nose of this savory blend of 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry and tart black plum skin flavor kicks off the palate, followed by potpourri, lavender and pine notes.",87,38,California
19120,US,"This is a balanced, steely white, showing minimal oak and simple layers of apple, pear and vanilla.",87,24,California
19130,US,"Flavors of plum, cherry, cassis, chalky earth, smoke and bell pepper. Still tight and chewy, with suggestions that the fruit from this difficult vintage didn’t attain full ripeness. A good effort from a subpar year, marked by a hint of brett on the finish.",87,16,Washington
19140,Spain,"More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever.",93,17,Andalucia
19150,US,"There is an insane amount of power in this wine, sourced from the mighty Bedrock, where the Zin is interplanted with Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. Blueberry, candied orange and rosemary complement one another, while a dustiness and minerality play tricks on the tongue, testifying about the vineyard's rocky soils.",90,43,California
19160,France,This ripe wine shows a good balance between its rich black fruits and the densely tannic structure. It is still young and for now the wine is firm and dry. The ripe fruit will blossom over the next few years to give warmth and richness. Drink from 2018.,90,20,Bordeaux
19170,US,"The winery blends 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec for this high-end red. Burly in tobacco and cedar, it also offers a floral, high-toned spirit built around juicy cranberry on the palate. With well-integrated tannins and oak, it finishes in a note of bittersweet chocolate.",90,150,California
19180,New Zealand,"Takes the bold ripeness of the regular Gunn Estate bottling and kicks it up by adding herbal, passion fruit and pineapple flavors to the mix. The rich, creamy texture is balanced by the freshness and minerality of the lingering finish.",91,19,Marlborough
19190,US,"The winery's basic Cab, with no vineyard designation, shares the qualities of the more expensive bottlings. It's dry and tannic and ultraconcentrated in varietal character, with explosive cassis, cherry and new oak flavors. Impresses now for its luxurious mouthfeel, and should develop through 2013.",91,50,California
19200,Italy,"Here is a creamy, smooth, and obviously well-made Vernaccia, with pretty honey-like aromas backed by peach, pear blossom and exotic fruit. It has a crisp, fruit-driven mouthfeel and ends with pretty floral nuances.",86,19,Tuscany
19210,US,"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.",86,22,California
19220,Chile,"The majority of Calina's wines are solid and worth their price, as is this lively Cab. It gets going with forward aromas of leather, cassis and earth. The palate isn't super structured or advanced but it does deliver sweet and smooth raspberry and plum fruit in front of a good finish. From Kendall-Jackson's Chilean winery.",86,9,Central Valley
19230,Italy,"Lungarotti's bright Pinot Grigio from Umbria offers sunny aromas of peach, orange peel and honeysuckle. There are mature fruit notes here with sweet overtones that would work with appetizers or light meals.",86,17,Central Italy
19240,Austria,"The slopes below the Stift Gottweig monastery are the source of this attractively crisp, light wine, its acidity and fresh fruit a pure pleasure to drink. There is a twist of minerality here, just to add extra interest. Screwcap.",86,23,Kremstal
19250,Georgia,"Deep straw in color, this semi-sweet wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has an aroma characterized by soft hints of apple. It is harmonious in the mouth, with flavors of ripe apple, white peach and apricot that meld into a finish marked by persistent floral sweetness.",87,12,Kakheti
19260,Italy,"Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, violet, wild berry and a whiff of menthol lead the nose on this bright, easygoing red.

19270,Italy,"Violet, raspberry, underbrush and wild herb aromas take center stage on this straightforward red. The lean, racy palate offers sour cherry and orange peel alongside vigorous acidity. This cries out for food, so enjoy it with hearty soups and pasta dishes.",87,24,Tuscany
19280,US,"Fresh, spicy and crisp, this deft Malbec shines with pretty raspberry fruit and sharp acidity. Focused and clean, it's a big step forward for this winery.",88,20,Washington
19290,US,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah had no problem achieving ripeness. It explodes in blackberry, cherry, chocolate, licorice, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that go on and on. The structure is a little too soft and weak to support all this weight, though. Drink now.",87,47,California
19300,Germany,"A complex array of floral tones builds throughout this medium-sweet Riesling. Green notes of iris and lily add refreshment to a backdrop of heady jasmine and orange blossom. The palate is intensely fruity with juicy white peach and apricot flavors accented with a zesty lime acidity that revitalizes. Delicately framed, yet decadent and ebullient.",94,92,Rheingau
19310,US,"Darker and more brooding than many of Newsome-Harlow's other single-vineyard bottlings in the 2011 vintage, the Shake Ridge is mighty in black pepper and dark chocolate, silky and voluptuous with mellowed tannins. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah, the ranch's Zin clones include Monte Rosso.",94,36,California
19320,US,"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.",94,75,California
19330,Italy,"Dark skinned berry, exotic spice, French oak and crushed blue flower aromas unfold on this. The firm palate displays dried red cherry, coffee, mint and toasted oak but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to balance the oak.",88,95,Tuscany
19340,US,"Graceful acidity balances the big flavor and salty oak of this wine, awash in bite-worthy green apple, tart quince and lemon. The body is medium but expertly textured, providing intense length and weight on the finish.",88,32,California
19350,Portugal,"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87,10,Lisboa
19360,US,"Made in the modern style, with fairly high alcohol, lots of sweet oak, and massively extracted cherry, berry and mocha flavors. It's smooth in tannins and complex, and is showing its best now and over the next few years.",88,49,California
19370,US,"This large-production Zin has lots to like, beginning with the smooth, dry tannins and continuing through the classic flavors of black currants, briary forest berries and exotic spices. It contains some Petite Sirah, which gives it added body and depth. Drink now with barbecue, beef tacos and pepperoni pizza.",88,24,California
19380,US,"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins.",89,25,California
19390,Chile,"Jammy, earthy and baked on the nose, this ripe Merlot is dishing plenty of black plum and blackberry characteristics from front to back. The palate is concentrated and borderline syrupy in feel, while ripe, baked blackberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and vanilla on the finish.",89,15,Colchagua Valley
19400,Italy,"Firm and juicy, this opens with intense aromas of violet, ripe berry and baking spice.

Enjoy it soon with everyday fare or for informal occasions.",89,20,Piedmont

19430,US,"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",86,40,California
19440,France,"Restrained in style, with modest pear and honey notes tinged with a toasty, mealy edge. Shows some nice creaminess to the midpalate, then fades gradually on the finish. Drink now.",85,52,Rh?ne Valley
19450,France,"The second wine of Médoc Ch?teau La Cardonne is a light, fruity wine with red berry fruits, acidity and a fresh tannin character. It is pleasingly ready to drink now.",85,17,Bordeaux
19460,Spain,"The opening of green apple and honeydew melon says Rueda all the way. The feel is cleansing and fresh, with piercing but proper acidity pushing flavors of green citrus, melon and green apple. Stony on the finish, with zest. Solid for near-term drinking; don't let it sit around for long.",87,14,Northern Spain
19470,South Africa,"A firm and well-structured Merlot with intriguing notes of woody spice and cigar tobacco woven into the black plum and dark berry flavors. Medium weight in the mouth with gripping tannins and a long, peppery finish. Drink soon and try with braised meats or lamb shanks.",87,24,Stellenbosch
19480,Italy,"Here's a thin, lean and easy-to-drink Sangiovese with a pretty aromatic ensemble of spice, blueberry and roasted nut.",85,6,Tuscany
19490,US,"This Pinot Gris offers a distinctive mix of flavors, with apple, pear, pink grapefruit and sweet Meyer lemon all in the tangle of fruit. It's sappy and soft, but runs afoul of some mousy, bacterial flavors in the finish. Except for that, it would score much better.",85,18,Oregon
19500,Italy,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot and Sangiovese is tad jammy and cooked. The wine delivers tight, tart tannins with impressive structure and length.",85,110,Tuscany

19520,US,"This wine is dark, sweet and slightly effervescent in texture. It has an inky color, aromas like Concord-grape juice and roses, and jammy flavors.",84,29,California
19530,Ukraine,"On the nose, this nonvintage sparkler from the Ukraine has primary notes of yeast and freshly baked bread There are soft flavors of green apple and peach in the mouth with gentle persistent bubbles.",83,10,Ukraine
19540,Italy,"Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and star anise set the tone of this full-bodied red. The palate is juicy and polished, full of ripe black cherry, tobacco, clove and tangerine zest flavors, ribbed with fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019??025.",90,110,Tuscany
19550,France,"The rosy floral overtones of Muscat are very evident on the fragrant nose.

Friendly and fresh with a dry finish.",90,15,Alsace
19560,Italy,"Dark spice, forest floor, sun-baked soil and toast aromas lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out raspberry jam, vanilla, licorice and espresso notes, while close-grained tannins provide firm support.",90,60,Tuscany
19570,US,"Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.",80,18,California
19580,France,"Although this is marked nonvintage, the fruit all comes from 2004. It is made from old vines, giving richness and ripeness, and a generous white fruit character which fully compensates for the very dry nature of the wine. It's delicious, a complex wine of intense character.",94,62,Champagne
19590,US,"This is a good, well-made Cabernet Sauvignon to enjoy now. It's nice and dry and sturdy in tannins, with oak-influenced blackberry and currant flavors. Shows some real sophistication.",89,49,California
19600,US,"Eola-Amity Hills has a distinctive “voice??in the newly-defined Willamette Valley AVAs.

The fruit is light and mixes cherry and citrus, and the tannins are proportionate and supple.",89,45,Oregon
19610,Portugal,"Mint and red-fruit aromas dominate this classic D?o wine, with its firm tannins and mineral structure. Spice, toast and dark-berry flavors give a feeling of weight to a wine that demands to be paired with rich red meats.",90,10,D?o

19640,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",84,18,New York
19650,US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",84,18,California
19660,US,"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",83,45,California
19670,US,"Black plum and black currant are jammy on the brambly nose. The smooth tannins take a backseat to the jammy and plummy black fruits on the medium-bodied palate. There is just enough acidity to keep this wine from turning flabby. Black plum, a touch of baking spice and warmth linger on the finish.",85,25,Colorado

19720,Argentina,"Ripe, concentrated blackberry, cassis, oak and graphite aromas set up a burly palate that's stacked to the max.

Drink through 2022.",92,75,Mendoza Province

19740,US,"This is a hearty version of the variety for this producer, known for its oft-lighter approach. It reveals skill as well, the grapes from another prime site overseen by brand partner Bill Price.

19750,US,"Plump blueberry, baked black plum, cracked-rock earthiness and bloody meats show in a reserved way on the nose of this bottling from one of California's oldest vineyards.

19770,US,"This bottling from a vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills by David and Anna deLaski explores the lower ripeness, exotically spiced range of Pinot Noir.

19810,Chile,"Given the $27 price, this “limited edition??Sauvignon is lacking in many places.

On the finish, it's like scallions and tarragon, with cutting acidity.",83,27,Casablanca Valley
19820,France,"Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity.

19830,US,"Big, big, big! This is a mountain-grown Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's tremendous all around.

19840,Austria,"The Nussberg vineyard towering above the western edge of Vienna is famed for its field blend Gemischter Satz (mixed varieties).

19900,US,"Similar to past bottlings, Bourassa's 2005 Syrah is slightly rustic. It has a baked-fruit quality of blackberry and black cherry pie filling, and is very peppery. Given the right fare, such as a pepper steak, it could work some magic.",85,30,California
19910,US,"Pours kind of pale and feels light in body in the mouth, with acidic flavors of cherry skins and anise. Nice for its clean silkiness, but there's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity.",85,34,California

Great with almost anything starring sausage.",87,18,California
20000,US,"A grilled steak will play nicely against the tannins and acids of this Syrah, grown in the cool Carneros district north of San Francisco. The black peppercorn and blackberry flavors suggest a butter-enriched wine reduction sauce. Best now and for a couple years.",87,25,California

20060,France,"This wine comes from a single vineyard on the south bank of the Vienne river. It is ripe, perfumed and generously rich with concentrated blackberry fruit and balanced tannins.

20210,France,"Big, bold and tannic, this is powerful Gamay from La Tour du Bief vineyard in Juliénas. It has weight, and a concentrated texture that bodes well for the wine's future. Along with this structure are the fragrant black and red currant fruits, already delicious to drink.",90,,Beaujolais

20250,US,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins. There is a green streak but it adds complexity and is not off-putting. This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak.",87,15,Washington
20260,US,"It's amazing how consistently good Lake County Sauvignon Blancs can be at such a good price, and with their '05, Wildhurst exemplifies these qualities.

21900,US,"This is an intriguing wine, with notes of dried sage, fresh herbs, mineral and black tea. The palate offers sweet, dense, layered vanilla, clove and cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Still young, this wine needs extended time in the cellar to be properly appreciated. Best after 2022.",89,65,Washington

21950,US,"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk.

It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",88,40,California
21970,US,"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results.

Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.",88,36,California

22230,US,"This started out as a perfectly nice Chardonnay. It was dry, crisp and balanced, with a minerality under the pineapple and peach flavors.

The palate is dry and streamlined, with a wonderfully racy focus of freshness and concentration. Yet this remains svelte and toned.

22370,US,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins.

22490,US,"With lemon, orange, apricot and green melon flavors, this is a fruity wine, with tart notes of green gooseberries that make it savory. There's a lot of honey on the finish that makes you wonder if it's truly dry or flirting with off-dry.",86,25,California
22500,France,"Just next door to the Corton Grand Cru vines, this vineyard can produce wines of equal quality.

22510,US,"Bright and clear, this young wine is powered by racy cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's a wine that will appeal to those who love primary, juicy, tangy red fruit, but will carry a long way in the cellar for those who value the extra dimensions that well-aged Pinot can convey. Tuck a few bottles away and watch as they blossom into complex wines with dusty elegance. Drink now through 2030.",94,48,Oregon
22520,France,"This wine is perfumed with cherries and red berries. Its structure, which is certainly there, is almost secondary to this brilliant fruit. Balanced with a mineral dryness, the wine is certainly going to age into a ripe, pure-fruited wine. Drink from 2020.",94,,Burgundy

22600,Portugal,"There are big tannins in this wine along with the hallmark perfumes that are typical of the grape. Also typical is the one-dimensional character of the 100% Touriga Nacional.

22680,US,"Renwood's tiny two-barrel production of its most expensive Zinfandel has aromas like vanilla and coconut and flavors as rich as milk chocolate and strawberry jam.

The layered bouquet releases tones of smoky graphite, dried fruit, prune, ginger, hummus and sweet strawberry jam.",93,,Veneto
22740,US,"This is the liquid version of buttered toast. It's that oaky. In the nose there's almost no fruit at all, but in the mouth, once you cut through the layers of wood and butter, there's some melon, pear and vanilla. But wood overrides that, too. In the finish it's all oak-driven spice and resin. If this all sounds like a lumberjack's special, it is",84,20,California
22750,Italy,"Paola Gloder's estate can do better than this, especially in a vintage like 1997. The wine is already showing signs of aging and it has a lightweight character. The fruit is pleasant enough, with soft tannins and ripeness, but it should be more exciting. Tasted twice.",84,60,Tuscany
22760,US,"The first whiff brings a noseful of sulfur, although most of it blows off on airing. The underlying flavors are lovely, though, suggesting citrus fruits and apple, supported by crisp acidity. Finishes clean and crisp. Would score higher except for the opening smell.",83,14,Oregon

22780,Germany,"Layers of luscious mango, tangerine and pineapple mark this gloriously fruity, forward Riesling.

22790,Portugal,"This rich, wood-aged wine is full of yellow fruits with a tight texture. Mineral driven, it's crisp with its apple acidity and bright, steely structure. It's so fresh now, but could age well to create a smooth, mellifluous wine from 2017.",90,55,D?o

22860,France,"Named after the Roman emperor who allowed planting of vines in Cahors (and elsewhere in France), this wine is a fine expression of rich, concentrated Malbec. It is powered by its tannins and young black fruits at this stage and needs several years to present its full, rich and concentrated potential. From 2019, this will be a serious wine.",93,70,Southwest France
22870,US,"This winery is approaching cult status, and for good reason. Rather than compete with over-extracted competitors, this bottling shows a medium richness that pairs black plum and dark chocolate with light mint and dried herbs. Oregano, thyme, sage, bay leaf and black pepper power the palate, where boysenberry fruit and pencil lead complete the fresh but layered experience.",93,99,California

22900,US,"This is a dry, tannic and extracted young red wine. Made mainly from Merlot, with 15% Malbec, it has blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Feels fancy in the mouth, and might pick up some bottle complexity over the next 3?? years.",88,60,California
22910,Italy,"Easily recognizable thanks to its elaborate bottle encrusted with Swarovski crystals, Diadema is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.

23070,US,"The tannins on this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend are strong. They numb the mouth, but not so much that you can't enjoy the ripe black currant, cassis and smoky oak flavors. With its inherent balance, the wine should have no trouble aging, so give it eight years in the cellar.",91,65,California
23080,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend has high ambitions, to judge by the richness. It is absolutely massive in blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and caramelized oak.

23200,US,"The aromatics jump out, an intriguing mix of cherry fruit, leather, coffee and mocha. This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate.

23540,US,"Herbal and juicy, this is a straightforward, larger-production wine with a grip of tannins supporting waves of coconut and red and black berry. It's well priced for the quality and is a good choice for everyday enjoyment.",85,20,California
23550,Chile,"Heavy aromas of burnt leaves, rubber and compost overshadow any berry fruit notes, while the palate is creamy in feel, with basic flavors of spiced, earthy cherry and berry. Fairly oaky on the finish and overall a step back in quality from previous vintages.",84,16,Casablanca Valley
23560,US,"A little sharp and rude in the mouth, with some green, minty flavors. But it's silky, and offers enough cherries and cola for an inexpensive Pinot Noir.",84,14,California
23570,US,"Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.",93,99,California
23580,US,"Crisp and luscious, this coastal Chardonnay shows off its cool-climate origins and fine vintage. Displays ripe pineapple tart, green apple butter and flamboyant lime flavors, enriched with sweet smoky oak, and balanced with clean, citrusy acidity.",93,45,California
23590,US,"Breggo has produced a fine, ageable Pinot Noir from this highly regarded vineyard. The wine is medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and complex, charming flavors of black and red cherries, cola, sweet leather, Asian spices and sandalwood. Delicious now and should hold through 2013.",93,55,California
23600,US,"Softly floral and brightly spicy, this wine rocks in red cherry and tangy citrus, sure to please a broad range of palates in its approachable elegance and restraint. Toasted vanilla oak rounds out the finish.",91,45,California
23610,US,"Light, clean and fresh on the nose, this bottling from a rather extremely sited vineyard on the western end of the appellation shows cut lawn, lemongrass, squeezed lime and wet concrete on the nose. The palate is zesty and sour at first, but a honeydew element warms it up nicely.",91,22,California
23620,France,"Crisp, tight and mineral, this classic wine has citrus and apple fruits filled out with creamed pear. The zingy texture is still young and vibrant. With intense acidity at the end, the wine could still develop, so drink from early 2017.",91,23,Burgundy
23630,US,"This wine certainly packs in the flavor. It has lots of jammy, grapy aromas, and flavors that drip boysenberry and blackberry, followed by baking-spice accents. It has a full body, an almost thick texture and mild acidity and tannins.",89,37,California
23640,France,"After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018.",89,71,Bordeaux
23650,US,"Fragrant tones of melon, mango and blossom introduce this lush, richly textured Chardonnay. On the palate, delicate swirls of cream juxtapose pristine lemon, apple and pear flavors. It's an elegant, neatly balanced dry white that should drink well now through 2016.",89,14,New York
23660,US,"With no oak influence, this Cabernet Franc is chock full of pristine raspberry and cherry notes. It's quite concentrated on the palate with deep, ripe red-fruit flavor, but marked by tart cranberry acidity and a long, lingering finish and just a hint of leafy green notes.",89,20,New York
23670,US,"The 2012 reserve costs only $3 more than the regular bottling, but it's a richer wine balanced with bright, citrusy acidity. The palate is dry with flavors of Bosc pears, green apples, vanilla cream and toasted marshmallows.",89,19,California
23680,US,"Though labeled simply Washington state, this Bordeaux-style blend is sourced entirely from Kiona's Red Mountain vineyards. The wine includes 20% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, yielding a deep, darkly fruited wine with cassis, black coffee, graphite and a whiff of barnyard. It's young, tight and chewy, but has excellent aging potential.",89,25,Washington
23690,US,"Dried lemon peels and a hint of butter-fried apples show on the nose. Strong lemon acidity drives the palate, with a touch of sea salt and stone fruit proving very familiar.",87,30,California
23700,US,"Age has mellowed this potent Port-style wine a bit but hardly tamed it. The dark auburn edge to the otherwise black color hints at its maturity as do the pruny nutty roasted-cherry flavors. It's very full bodied and definitely sweet, but not cloying.",87,45,California
23710,Portugal,"The entry-level white wine from this young Douro estate is ripe, juicy with tropical fruits and a lightly oxidative character that gives it extra richness. The wine has plenty of acidity as well as citrus crispness. It finishes with a creamy texture. Drink now.",87,12,Douro
23720,France,"This pale salmon rosé is fresh and clean. It opens with bright aromas of strawberry hull, watermelon rind and citrus peel that carry through to the linear yet vibrant palate. The palate boasts excellent verve and refreshment, making this a perfect choice for warm-weather enjoyment. Drink now.",88,17,Languedoc-Roussillon
23730,Italy,"This generous, friendly red opens with aromas that recall ripe dark berry and star anise. The round, juicy palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed black cherry, licorice and ground pepper alongside soft, supple tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,20,Sicily & Sardinia
23740,Portugal,"Grown in the southern part of the Minho, close to the Douro, this Alvarinho is a ripe while still textured and tangy wine. It has fine, fresh lemon acidity that's rounded out by apricot and pear flavors. Drink now.",87,13,Minho
23750,Spain,"This is a very nice value wine with balsam wood, almond candy, cola and black-fruit aromas. The palate feels pure and fresh, with a ton of plum, berry, cocoa and tobacco flavors. It's smooth, long and solid on the finish.",88,12,Catalonia
23760,US,"Made in a high-alcohol, extracted style, this Petite is explosive in blackberry jam, currant and spice flavors. The tannins are brisk, as you'd expect with this variety, while a pleasant streak of acidity cuts across the richness and gives the wine zest. Drink now.",88,29,California
23770,Portugal,"This is a soft blend of five local varieties, offering a generous, concentrated wine. Black fruit tones are balanced by a strong mineral character that brings out a tight texture. From the end of 2016, it will be a fine, ripe and accessible wine.",89,13,D?o
23780,France,"Creaminess, almost akin to cream soda, emanates from the glass and subdues the soft strawberry fruit. The palate has some of that creaminess, too, but is fresh and pleasingly taut, with bright freshness and a light, dry body. The fizz is frothy and altogether results in an immensely drinkable, easy-to-enjoy crémant.",89,40,Alsace
23790,Argentina,"Dark, ripe, tarry aromas announce a macho Malbec. This is jammy and pulpy in texture, with more than enough extraction. Herbal, woodsy black-fruit flavors are supported by an oaky, resiny finish with black-pepper spice notes. Drink through 2018.",89,20,Mendoza Province
23800,Italy,"This structured white opens with enticing scents of citrus and orchard fruit. The vibrant, full-bodied palate delivers lime, grapefruit and yellow peach accompanied by lively acidity. A mineral note signals the finish.",89,22,Northeastern Italy
23810,France,"Rather perfumed, lifted notes of honeysuckle and the full force of lemon-drizzled honeydew melon make for a striking opening. The palate is bright and brings ample fruit: citrus-tempered apple, plums, apricots and peaches. This is joyous in its exuberance, even without much complexity. Drink soon.",89,42,Alsace
23820,Italy,"Lightly perfumed with hawthorn flower and orchard fruit aromas, this linear white offers flavors of green apple, lime and tangerine zest. Crisp acidity supports the palate while a mineral note closes the tangy finish.",89,17,Northeastern Italy
23830,France,"Soft and creamy, this floral wine also has an attractive touch of toastiness suggesting it has bottle age. Its green-plum and citrus flavors contribute to the crispness of this balanced wine. Drink now.",88,35,Champagne
23840,US,"A light earthy aroma and enjoyable savory flavors suggesting dried herbs, bouillon and canteloupe characterize this deceptively full-bodied, dry wine. It has a nervy, crisp texture, great acidity and intriguing complexity.",88,24,California
23850,New Zealand,Tropical fruit flavors are brightened by lemon-lime citrus notes and a hint of the variety's trademark grassiness. A slippery smooth texture and balanced acidity make this easy to drink on its own.,88,11,Marlborough
23860,South Africa,"This delicious rosé is a combination of sweet strawberry and a touch of lemon crispness on the nose and the palate. Its light, elegant character is supported by a dancing acidity and a balance of ripe berry flavors and minerality. A great food pairing choice or stellar solo sip.",90,30,Stellenbosch
23870,Spain,"Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors. Big at 14.5%, but it will go really well with baked fish or lobster.",90,71,Northern Spain
23880,France,"Inspired by Sancerre, but with grapes from other parts of the Loire, this soft, herbal and green-fruit flavored wine is refreshing and lightly textured. Drink now.",85,15,Loire Valley
23890,Argentina,"This has an oily gritty nose and a palate with lemony acidity. Flavors of lemon and green currant fall off and turn a touch bitter on the finish, something you could probably predict given the gritty start.",85,12,Mendoza Province
23900,US,"Green herb, dried tobacco and vanilla aromas are followed by light, easygoing fruit flavors. It comes off as quite green.",85,25,Washington
23910,US,"With sharp acidity, a hot mouthfeel and rich flavors of cassis liqueur and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend tastes more like Port than a dry table wine. Lots of new French oak does not restore balance. Drink up.",82,150,California
23920,US,"A simple wine, it tastes overoaked and thin in oranges and apricots, with brisk acidity.",82,22,California
23930,US,"This is harsh and scoury in the mouth, with thin blackberry and caramel flavors and some vegetal notes.",82,17,California
23940,France,"89-91 Fine tannins, with plenty of juicy fruit. The wine has wonderful sweetness to go with the acidity.",90,,Bordeaux
23950,France,"88-90 Acidity and fresh fruit are out of balance with smoky wood. The wine will need to integrate in the coming months, although all the elements are there.",89,,Bordeaux
23960,US,"If you're looking for classic Napa Cabernet, this utterly delicious bottling is right there. Blended with some Petit Verdot and Merlot, it's a selection of the winery's extensive acreage across the Stags Leap, Rutherford, Carneros and Oakville appellations, showcasing the synergy of blending. The wine is dry, full-bodied, firm in tannins and extraordinarily lush, with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, plum, toasty oak and spice flavors. It's so good now thay you can drink it, but it holds the inherent balance to age for up to 15 years.",94,150,California
23970,Australia,"Always one of Yalumba's top offerings, the 2008 doesn't show any of the vintage's ill effects. Instead, this blend of Cabernet (56%) and Shiraz (44%) offers a rich, open-knit mouthful of chocomint and dark plum, underscored by savory, meaty notes. This is full bodied and supple, yet muscular, with at least a decade of cellaring potential.",94,54,South Australia
23980,France,"The near-vertical slope of the Monts Damnés produces wines that have great elegance, style and impressive richness. This 2011 is still young, needing another year to start to bring out all the complex texture and aromatics. Drink until 2020.",93,30,Loire Valley
23990,US,"The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls “seasoned barriques??that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.",92,60,California
24000,Austria,"While the wine is technically dry, its richness gives it a sweeter sensation. The ripe apricot and pineapple fruit is cut with knife-like acidity, allowing this concentrated wine to remain poised, with a crisp finish.",92,39,Kremstal
24010,Spain,"Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry. It's long and supple late, and it's arguably one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons you'll find from Spain and Navarra.",92,50,Northern Spain
24020,US,"Toast, spice, lees and baked-apple aromas are followed by medium-bodied flavors that show restraint.",87,22,Washington
24030,US,"Ripe honeydew melon and grapefruit flavors are edged with lime acidity in this sunny, dry wine. It's refreshing and crisp, with a hint of dusty mineral on the finish.",87,14,New York
24040,France,"With vineyards located in the far southeast of the Bordeaux appellation, this wine is very crisp and clean, this is a fruity wine, packed with green plum, citrus and sliced apple flavors. It is ready to drink now with its bright acidity and lightly perfumed aftertaste.",87,12,Bordeaux
24050,Argentina,"Big, bulky and granular, with high alcohol and saucy, raisiny aromas. The palate and flavors find a comfortable resting spot, and the wine's baked berry and brown sugar flavors are solid if a little forced and sweet. A rich wine that needs to be drunk soon.",85,20,Mendoza Province
24060,Argentina,"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat. The palate has biting tannings and toughness, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry are snappy. Finishes strange, with pronounced butter and foxiness. Has its positives and negatives.",85,15,Mendoza Province
24070,US,"Nebbiolo has proved to be an enormously difficult grape to grow outside of a few small areas in Northern Italy, but Three Fox Vineyards has done an admirable job. There's pleasant strawberry fruit here with an earthy underpinning of fresh tar. In the mouth, Nebbiolo's trademark grippy tannins proved a backdrop for intense, cherry fruit. Give the tannins a few years to mellow out, then serve with London broil.",85,30,Virginia
24080,Argentina,"Floral, exotic blueberry aromas come with baking-spice notes. A palate lifted by integrated acidity offers layered blueberry, cardamom and chocolate flavors. The full spicy blue-fruit finish is warm and lasting. If you know Achaval-Ferrer's wines, this will be familiar and fitting.",90,25,Mendoza Province
24090,France,"There are some terrific bargains to be found in the Costières de N?mes, including this offering from Michel Gassier. This blend of 45% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 15% Carignan, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault, features scents of thyme and bay leaf alongside black cherry and plum fruit. Hints of baking spices and mocha add nuance to the dusty, muscular finish. A solid choice for steak or burgers.",90,22,Rh?ne Valley
24100,South Africa,"Attractive fynbos and fresh grass notes are front and center on the nose of this refreshing white wine. Notes of lime, green plum and gooseberry unfold with more intensity on the palate, while the herbal elements return on the medium-length finish. Medium acidity and a subtle astringency lend a pleasant, clean and dry texture to the mouthfeel. Drink now.",90,22,Stellenbosch
24110,US,"The winery does not give us exact new oak statistics, but oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cab. Beyond the caramel, smoke and toasty vanilla meringue, the blackberry and currant flavors are a little thin.",85,52,California
24120,US,"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit.",85,90,California
24130,US,"This is an inky-black wine, with soft, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and oak. The tannins are mountain thick but as refined as modern winemaking can make them. And the finish? Sweet and dry at the same time, which only a good wine can accomplish. Needs 5?? years in the cellar.",92,75,California
24140,Italy,"This is a sophisticated effort that opens with lively aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, papaya, pineapple, vanilla and ripe apricot. It's a beautiful wine, with a bold and opulent mouthfeel and a finish that lasts minutes.",92,76,Northeastern Italy
24150,Austria,"Ripe and creamy, this is full of rich pear and green plum fruit. It has weight and is layered with acidity, with a spice note and a taut, mineral texture. This is complex and age worthy.",92,20,Kamptal
24160,Spain,"Chunky obtuse aromas of berry fruits are a bit damp and volatile. This is heavy and severely tannic, while blackened berry and prune flavors come across a bit stewed. A drawing tannic finish brings this to a close.",87,28,Northern Spain
24170,Italy,"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, this has aromas of black currant, forest floor and a whiff of graphite. The straightforward palate shows black plum, raspberry jam and a whiff of licorice accompanied by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,16,Central Italy
24180,US,"Ripe and plummy in explosive fruit and heat, this wine shows cherry-berry jamminess wrapped in a leathery, meaty package dusted in cinnamon and brown sugar.",87,34,California
24190,Italy,"I THINK THIS WINE WAS ALREADY PUBLISHED - SENT IT TWICE.   On top of pear, apple and acacia, the nose of this luminous white awards notes of wild flower, kiwi or cut grass. It delivers great vibrancy and is tight and tonic in the mouth.",87,18,Southern Italy
24200,Argentina,"Mildly roasted and leafy, with dry berry aromas. This is ripe and juicy on the palate, with berry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Finishes almost creamy, with honest structure and medium-range tannins. Drink now.",87,14,Mendoza Province

24220,US,"Fresh and fragrant like a thicket of raspberries on a summer day, this is a luxuriously fruity, yet impeccably balanced Pinot Noir.

Layers of soft, finely grained tannins characterize the long finish.",90,30,New York

24240,US,"For fifteen bucks you get a nice, silky Pinot Noir with some pretty good fruit and crisp, palate-stimulating coastal acidity. The flavors of cherries, currants and cola will play well with a beef taco.",85,15,California
24250,US,"The Tempranillo—bud wood from Abacela—was grafted onto 30-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Not sure how many vintages have been made, but it's too soon to rate the experiment. This is a lightly toasty, rather elegant red with little varietal character, but it's nicely built and perfectly fine for a simple supper.",85,26,Oregon
24260,US,"This has everything that many people love about Chardonnay: It's creamy, buttery and toasty, with sweet tropical fruit and pear flavors. It's pretty flashy.",87,18,California
24270,US,This is an appealing Cabernet with spicy cola and plum notes and a consistent flavor through the midpalate. It finishes with a hint of toasty oak.,87,28,California
24280,Italy,"Anas-C?tta is an irresistible wine for those who seek little-known, offbeat grape varieties. Made from 100% Nascetta (a native grape vinified by a handful of producers), this is a bold, powerful wine with the heft and natural alcohol to cut through cream or cheese. It brightens the palate with stone fruit and citrus flavors.",88,29,Piedmont
24290,Italy,"Executed in a ramato style (with a copperish color), this oak-aged Pinot Grigio offers aromas of white cherry and cranberry followed by rose and candied lemon. Crisp acidity helps break apart the wine's creamy texture.",88,15,Veneto
24300,US,"A very well-done Livermore Cab aged in 100% Hungarian oak and named “The Good Life,??this one's got plum and spicy cola going on and tastes young though it's a 2008. Its structure shows more potential to age—the fruit will integrate with the wine's subtle savory herbs.",88,40,California
24310,Argentina,"Deep in color, with raisiny, fully ripe and heavy aromas. Feels tannic, extracted and rubbery, but amid the weight and bite there's black plum, pepper and coffee flavors. Finishes with drawing tannins and a dark wave of toasty flavor. A big wine with mouthfeel issues.",85,17,Mendoza Province
24320,Greece,"The nose on this red dessert wine is intriguing, with its combination of floral freshness and cedar and tobacco spice. On the palate, it has a heavier hand, with dried fruit, raisin and tobacco flavors. A richer sip with a masculine edge.",85,13,Mavrodaphne of Patras
24330,Argentina,"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.",85,16,Mendoza Province
24340,US,"You've got to love the name (there have been Henry II, III and IV's made, with different blends of grapes). This is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Franc, 9% Syrah and 5% Malbec. The nose shows earth and stem first, with some sweet grape and red fruits underneath. Balanced and fruit forward, with plenty of tart acids.",86,23,Oregon

24460,US,"You'll want to give this vigorous young Cab time in the cellar to come around.

Give it until 2017 to begin to come around.",92,65,California
24470,US,"This Pinot's immediate lusciousness belies its complexity. Your first impression is of ripe raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie.

Lovely now and over the next six years, after an hour or two in the decanter.",92,59,California

24630,Chile,"A touch syrupy and saucy on first blush, with a full, healthy, ripe palate that's typically Chilean due to herb, berry and leather flavors. Sound, smooth and driven on the finish, with overall good vibrations for an organic wine.",87,14,Colchagua Valley
24640,US,"This is Pinot on the edge of ripeness, with layers of herb and tomato leaf threaded in with tart wild berry fruit. The tannins are a little rough, but overall the balance is right and the wine does not overreach.",87,,Oregon
24650,Italy,"This is but the second vintage in the states of this rich, internationally styled Sangiovese from this catch-all DOC near Montalcino. It's chewy, thick and packed full of black plum and blackberry. Full yet nonaggressive tannins solidify the balance, while potent hints of bitter chocolate and coffee rise up on the finish.",88,17,Tuscany
24660,US,"Ripe, premium fruit and fairly high alcohol levels define this wine. A hot year and ripe fruit combine to create complexity in the nose, with an interesting mix of spices (cardamom, clove), lots of tannin, some darker fruit, and hints of smoke and earth. The only down side: it lacks weight and it finishes very tannic.",88,35,Oregon
24670,US,"About 40% is  barrel aged and put through malolactic. This is a heavier, more substantial effort than their regular Chardonnay, with more butterscotch flavors showing. With good fruit, some weight and texture, it's well made and a good value.",88,10,Oregon
24680,US,"A good everyday Zinfandel whose full-bodied, spicy fruitiness will satisfy with barbecue. It's a rugged, somewhat rustic wine with briary flavors of wild blackberries, leather, cola and pepper. Drink now.",85,18,California
24690,US,"One of the best inexpensive Pinot Noirs on the market, which is quite an achievement considering that most at this price are awful. The wine is dry and silky, with pleasant flavors of cola, cherries and spice.",85,11,California
24700,Portugal,"The Estremadura region, north of Lisbon, is at the western extremity of mainland Europe. It produces a good line in this style of fresh, crisp wines, light and bright. There is just a hint of sweetness, with currant flavors and a final softness.",85,9,Estremadura
24710,US,"Smooth and seductive, scented with sandalwood, tasting of butterfat, toast and chocolate, layered around generous fruit. Cherry, currant and plum lead into polished tannins and lots of chocolaty oak.",90,40,Washington
24720,US,"This inky-black Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's bone dry, tremendously hard in tannins and also quite acidic, giving the overall impression of tough rusticity. However, there's a tremendous core of blackberries and cassis. Decant and drink now.",86,22,California
24730,Italy,"Aromas include toasted wood, smoky mineral and yellow apples. The palate offers oak, a hint of lemon zest and a medicinal sensation alongside racy acidity. There's not enough fruit richness to support the oak or the acidity. It ends on a bitter note.",85,31,Lombardy
24740,US,"The winery specializes in Zinfandel. While the Maboroshi Vineyard has produced great Pinots for other wineries, this one is tough in tannins. Give it a good, long decant and drink up.",85,42,California
24750,US,"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes.",93,44,California
24760,France,"Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.",93,60,Alsace
24770,US,"Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element.",93,65,California
24780,France,"The wine is ripe and rounded, full of red cherry and raspberry flavors. It has weight and enough richness while not losing its acidity.",90,22,Provence
24790,Portugal,"Wood-aged wine that shows pedigree and style. It has red berry fruit flavors, firm tannins along with acidity and a dry core. It's a serious wine, for aging over 4?? years.",89,14,Douro
24800,France,"This is the second wine of Grand Cru Classé Ch?teau la Gaffelière. It revels in ripe juicy Merlot while keeping a sense of style and elegance. Produced by the Malet-Roquefort family, owners since 1705, the wine has some firm tannins while never losing sight of the generous black fruits. Drink from 2022.",93,,Bordeaux
24810,US,"This winery, with its Los Alamitos tasting room east of Long Beach, sources from a variety of vineyards to make some impressive wines. This bottling shows crushed black pepper, tar, roasted lamb and savory herb notes on the nose. The palate is tangy with underripe boysenberry, thyme, black tea and roasted lamb flavors.",93,38,California
24820,US,"This best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak, and is comprised of fruit from the Nysa and Lachini vineyards, which are also featured as vineyard designate bottlings for this new project from Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery). The oak is showing strongly at the moment, with baking spices galore, suggesting gingerbread cookies and dried cherries. The tannins could use a bit more bottle age to soften up, but it's built to last. Drink 2020??030.",93,70,Oregon
24830,Greece,"Lemon and pineapple aromas start this full-bodied but friendly pour from the Peloponnese. Citrus, sea salt and a mineral finish give the wine elegance and a versatile food character.",90,12,Peloponnese
24840,France,"Lithe and perfumed notes of mandarin hit the nose before more gentle but refreshing mandarin and tangerine show on the palate of this wine. Pliable and fresh, it has zesty concentration at the core and is a joy to drink.",90,,Alsace
24850,Chile,"Initially, this smells heavy, earthy, nutty and even a bit raisiny. In the mouth, this is chunky and rich, with pounding tannins. The flavor profile is much like a chocolate parfait, with sweet, nutty, spicy notes. On the finish, copious oak is reflected via clove, mint and wood-spice flavors. Drink this lush, sticky Carmenère through 2021.",90,60,Colchagua Valley
24860,France,"An off-dry aromatic wine, showing peach and apricot fruits, with stewed pears that give richness. It is balanced, with an attractive crisp acidity sharpening up the soft texture. It's ready to drink now with its forward fruitiness.",87,14,Loire Valley
24870,Hungary,"While ebulliently floral and fruity with notes of orange blossom and white peach, a bracing hit of lemon balm and lime zest make this bright, brisk Grüner Veltliner especially refreshing. It lingers long on the palate with a bristling minerality.",87,11,Hungary
24880,France,"This is a really fruity rosé that is full of red-berry fruits and bright acidity. Crisp on the palate with tart red-currant flavors, there's a tightness in acidity that could benefit with more integration. Let the bottle settle a few months before opening.",85,,Champagne
24890,Chile,"Toasty aromas announce a strong barrel influence, but otherwise there's not much going on. In the mouth, this is plump and soft, with moderate acidity. Flavors of baked apple are heavy, warm and finish resiny, with a leftover note of tropical fruits including melon.",85,14,Casablanca Valley
24900,US,Sweet black raspberry and cherry fruit marks this likeable Cab. It has a soft mellowness that makes it easy to drink now.,85,13,California

24920,US,"This is a strong wine, dark and oaky, with rich flavors of licorice, toffee and espresso. The fruit is washed in Bourbon barrel flavor. It's impressively rich, but a bit overpowering.",87,36,Washington
24930,US,"A few words that describe this wine are lusty, brawny, rustic, really ripe, jammy, peppery, smooth and spicy. In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs.",88,20,California
24940,US,"This is an interesting bottle from sourced fruit (rather than estate-grown). Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is matched to ripe tannins; the wine is dark, almost sultry, and the flavors flow seamlessly across the palate. There is a spicy lift and a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) that concludes the presentation.",88,55,Oregon
24950,Portugal,"Properly almost black in color (as befits a wine from the red-juiced Alicante Bouschet), this wine reveals an impressive depth of flavor. It is dark and concentrated, powered by still-young tannins. There is an unfortunate edge of extraction that takes away from the ripe black-plum fruit and the acidity. It will be ready from 2019.",90,77,Tejo
24960,Portugal,"A crisp wine, fruity and with a good sense of acidity and citrus fruits. Being made from Alvarinho, it also has a richer background to give this wine great intensity despite its light weight. It is the sort of Alvarinho that needs to age, so drink ideally from early 2018.",90,23,Vinho Verde
24970,US,"From a ranch planted many decades ago, this wine includes mixed blacks such as Grand Noir and Carignane, adding juicy red and black fruit to the mix. Smoke, cinnamon and leather highlights are kept firm by an integrated tannic structure.",90,39,California
24980,Spain,"Dusty, minerally white-fruit aromas are generic but appealing. This blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca has a chunky palate with modest acidity. Green-melon flavors are round but flatten out and turn slightly bitter in front of a basic finish.",87,30,Northern Spain
24990,Spain,"Granulated berry and plum aromas are slightly reduced and come with an animal note on this Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A flush, weighty palate is well balanced, while flavors of dark plum and cassis finish tannic and a bit rubbery.",87,11,Levante
25000,US,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec offers vanilla, herb and cherry aromas that seem a bit coarse. The palate is full of baking spice flavors—notably vanilla. It's heavy on the oak notes, despite having aged in just 42% new French barrels, the rest older French and American.",87,25,Washington
25010,US,"Delicious. This is a full-bodied blush bubbly with instant appeal, from the coppery color to the long, spicy finish. Shows lush flavors of creamy raspberries and red cherries, brioche, vanilla and cinnamon spice, with a nutty sweetness. Elegant and complex. Drink now.",93,36,California
25020,US,"Shows the soft tannins and slight herbal quality of a top Alexander Valley Cab, along with low-yield mountain concentration of red and black currants, mocha and spice. Drink this polished, supple wine through 2012.",92,60,California
25030,Chile,"Cool, foresty, woodsy aromas of smoky berry fruits are solid and well formed. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah is chunky, with tannic grab and freshness. Flavors of baked, herbal berry fruits are spicy and earthy, while mint, licorice root and loamy notes define the finish.",88,26,Maipo Valley
25040,Spain,"Fresh, minerally red-fruit aromas suggest raspberry and plum. This is juicy, crisp and nicely cut for under-$10 wine. A firm grip delivers both tannic bite and finesse, while pure red-fruit flavors suggest freshness.",88,9,Catalonia
25050,US,"This Chardonnay already shows quite a bit of age. Hazelnut and chestnut dominate the nose with burnt lemon peel acidity at the edges. The palate picks up roasted marshmallow and roasted nut flavors, followed by a toffee finish. Drink now.",88,29,California
25060,US,"This wine is somewhat weedy and herbal, with extracted black fruit displaying prominently on the palate. Oaky and tannic, it overwhelms somewhat, needing time in the glass to settle down.",85,55,California
25070,France,"This ripe wine is fruity, with both citrus and tropical flavors. Light and bright, with a crisp, tangy texture, it's ready to drink.",85,16,Bordeaux
25080,Portugal,"The wine is rounded and fat with an oily texture. Its ripe apple and rich pear flavors only allow a small place for the acidity and crisp texture. It comes across as full bodied, rich and easy to drink now.",85,17,Tejo
25090,Italy,"Aromas of toasted oak, butterscotch and hazelnut lead the nose on this brawny white. The flamboyant, full-bodied palate offers dried citrus fruit, candied ginger, vanilla, honey and a confectionary note. The rich flavors have a certain appeal but the heat of evident alcohol throws it off balance.",87,38,Central Italy
25100,US,"A bit light in aromas, this appellation blend slowly shows dried cranberry, slight raspberry, juniper and wet earth. The clean but simple flavors surround iron, more dried cranberry and a pinch of dried herbs.",87,35,California
25110,US,"Soft, sunny acidity and luscious mouthfeel give this Chardonnay an overall plushness. The palate is marked by creamy peach and apple flavors accented by delicate wisps of vanilla and spice. While straightforward in style, it's supple and pleasing.",87,13,New York
25120,Argentina,"Berry and rubber band are the lead aromas. The wine has texture and lasting freshness despite being more than a year old already. It's medium in size and body, with red fruit and apple skin flavors. Solid, fruity and just lively enough.",86,9,Mendoza Province
25130,US,"This is a Rh?ne-style blend of mostly Grenache and Syrah, with smaller amounts of Viognier and Cinsault. The wine opens with appealing spices, but turns tart and stemmy in the mouth. The spiced plum fruit flavors compete somewhat unsuccessfully with bitter tannins. More bottle age should help.",86,19,Washington
25140,US,"Tastes sharp in acidity and frankly sweet, with sugary blackberry and cherry jam flavors that finish in a swirl of baking spices. The blend is Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah.",86,36,California
25150,Portugal,"A rich, spicy wood-aged wine, this has as much vanilla as fruit. That gives a strongly toasty character to the wine that needs to soften to bring out the green plum and melon flavors and the acidity. It's obviously a ripe wine, leaving a pepper character from the alcohol at the end.",88,15,Alentejano
25160,Portugal,"Full and rounded, the wine is rich and smooth, cut with acidity and a steely, mineral texture. With Arinto, Vital and Viosinho in the blend, pineapple and peach flavors are dominant and ripe. It's a full-bodied wine that is ready to drink.",88,21,Lisboa
25170,US,"Pale in color, this wine is aromatically quiet with notes of berry and herb, while the smoke notes emerge over time. The flavors are full and juicy but still bring a sense of delicacy, with a lingering finish. Give it time to open up.",88,40,Washington
25180,US,"Syrah makes up three-quarters of this wine with Grenache (20%) and Syrah accounting for the rest. It's fragrant with aromas of raspberry, cherry, herb and allspice that lead to plush, downright jammy fruit flavors that still show a deft touch.",88,25,Washington
25190,US,"This wine presents aromas of flowers and purple fruit that are almost animalistic in nature. The palate boasts bright acidity and firm but far from inaccessible tannins. It's the purity, however, that most impresses.",88,24,Washington
25200,US,"This rich Syrah leaves little to the imagination. It's dramatic in blackberry and cherry fruit and exotic spices, sweetened with new oak. Delicious now and for the next few years.",92,36,California
25210,Italy,"This is a broad, masculine Brunello with layers of spice, leather, Spanish cedar, cola and cured meat. The mouthfeel is streamlined and elegant, with crisp acidity and a solidly tannic base.",92,60,Tuscany
25220,US,"With nearly 20% residual sugar, this wine is enormously sweet in honey and black cherry flavors, balanced by brilliant acidity. It's delicious and savory and so easy to like. For something unusual, try with a runny cheese, like a soft Gorgonzola.",92,21,California
25230,US,"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",87,34,California
25240,Australia,"A pleasant surprise, this budget-priced Viognier shows plenty of plump fruit without getting overly big or blowsy. Citrus and pineapple flavors reflect the moderate alcohol levels, finishing on a juicy, succulent note. Drink now.",87,15,Australia Other
25250,Germany,"Smoked nuts and dusty minerals accent lemon and pink grapefruit notes in this off-dry, refreshingly brisk Riesling. Tart tangerine and white peach flavors are juicy on the palate, lingering into a finish that's softly astringent in tea-like tannins.",87,14,Mosel
25260,Spain,"Earthy plum and berry aromas bring a floral note. This feels firm, rubbery and tight, with raw tannins and bright acidity. Earthy, rubbery blackberry flavors offer hints of chocolate and fig, while the finish is leathery and a touch salty.",87,14,Northern Spain
25270,US,"This smells considerably more developed than its age would indicate, with notes of dried cranberries and cherries mixed with barrel spices and game. The palate brings more heft than expected at the labeled alcohol level, with abundant cranberry flavors throughout.",87,35,Oregon
25280,Italy,"Here's a fun sparkler made from Pinot Grigio that offers a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flowers and hints of tropical fruit. It has a quenching palate , with green apple and tangerine flavors along with a crisp, clean finish.",86,16,Northeastern Italy
25290,US,"Barbera topping 16% abv is a bit surprising, but despite this, the wine does not deliver much fruit power. It's chalky, hot and tannic, with the alcohol overpowering the simple red fruit.",86,32,Washington
25300,Italy,"Here's a fresh and easygoing Friulano that counts consistency, persistency and texture as its strongest features. The wine is thick with glycerin and heft and although it offers straightforward aromas of honey and peach on the nose, its mouthfeel is actually very elegant.",87,34,Northeastern Italy
25310,Italy,"American wine lovers should definitely make an effort to seek and taste Pinot Bianco, a white wine from northern Italy. The variety has excellent structure and softness for easy food pairing and offers measured tones of peach and melon that won't interfere with delicate seafood dishes.",87,19,Northeastern Italy
25320,Italy,"This is a genuine Ripasso that boasts distinctive aromas of Indian spice, ground ginger, white almond and root beer. There's a cool note of freshness on the close that is backed by plush flavors of mature fruit.",87,27,Veneto
25330,Italy,"This 2007 Brunello is a big, opulent pleasure bomb with lavish layers, loaded thickly on top of each other: Chocolate fudge, dark cherry, blackberry preserves, rum cake, prune, exotic spice, pipe tobacco, cola, humus and leather. It shows huge personality, intensity and staying power, too. All that density is backed by solid tannins and a steady firmness. Hold 10??5 years.",95,50,Tuscany
25340,Italy,"La Magia Brunello is a brooding, masculine wine filled with tobacco smoke and cigar box. At the back are tones of dried fruit, blackberry preserves, crème de cassis and prune. It shows wonderful intensity and elegance with loads of personality. Spice, black pepper and bitter chocolate also appear on the long, silky finish. It promises to age well.",94,50,Tuscany
25350,Italy,"This Brunello offers bright aromas with lively cherry, cola, humus, dark spice and pipe tobacco, as well as savory tones of beef bresaola and even a touch of white peppercorn. Impressive complexity. Elegant and streamlined on the close.",94,64,Tuscany
25360,US,"This brisk Pinot offers a rich array of raspberries and cherries, with oak influences. It's bright in acidity, with a dry finish, and the alcohol is relatively low. It tastes a little rude and rustic now, but could develop some bottle complexity over the next 5?? years.",87,48,California
25370,US,"Still tannic and acidic after all these years, this dry Grenache offers a ripe heart of cherries and cherry liqueur. Earns a point or two for elegance. Drink now.",87,35,California
25380,Austria,"Very ripe, juicy yellow Comice pear seems to drip from this lip-smacking, charming wine. At the core a vein of wonderful, lively acidity gives acidity and lots of drive. For now this concentrated wine shows zesty fruit but it also has stores of minerality.",94,55,Kremstal
25390,US,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon grown on the vintner's estate, this wine is holding back some of its complexity now in lieu of aging potential. Smoky oak, bay leaf, ripe raspberry, cherry and cedar tones remain elusive and subtle on the palate. This is an elegant wine, vibrant in red fruit and light spice. Cellar it through 2022.",94,140,California
25400,Austria,"This offers brooding, sumptuous, dark cherry fruit tinged with red rose petals. On the palate the core of ripe, intense cherry holds white pepper spice. Everything is still tightly held: wait and this will become even more engrossingly seductive. Drink as of 2017.",94,40,Thermenregion
25410,Portugal,"What has become Portugal's national red grape shows well here. It has the characteristic violet and hedgerow berry fruit perfumes that go with some firm tannins and black currant fruit flavors. It is a wine that will be ready to drink soon, so just wait until late 2016.",90,20,Alentejano
25420,US,"Not a showy wine, but this is well balanced, aromatic, flavorful and feels right on the palate. It smells like red cherries and black plums, and tastes fruity with spicy undertones. A touch of tannin and a dash of good acidity give it poise.",90,30,California
25430,US,"A grippy, powerfully concentrated wine, this is rich and full bodied in every way. It packs dense heaps of tobacco leaf with tar and baked, almost dried plum. A luxurious, decadent quaff from a Calistoga-based producer, it shows the vintage well.",90,62,California
25440,France,"This is more about elegance than power, a fresh wine with sweet fruit, and so elegant. The tannins do promise some good aging, but this is not a long-term wine. Hold for 8??0 years, but it is already a pleasure to drink.",91,,Bordeaux
25450,South Africa,"As expected, this wine's vines are next to a gravel quarry in Paarl, a region known for producing powerful reds. Big flavors of black currant and berry are balanced by a poised acidity and spicy wood character, and while assertive, the wine maintains an elegant, dry reserve. Drink now or wait 2?? years.",91,45,Paarl
25460,Greece,"A nose of lemon, tropical fruit and flowers gives this vibrant Chardonnay from Chateau Julia a clean start. Lively with fresh fruit and floral flavors, it's crisp with depth. A great food wine—or one to sip alone.",88,20,Drama
25470,US,"Good and smooth, with complex Napa tannins and flavors of black currants and cedar along with a firm earthy minerality that must come from the soil. A bit tannic and distant, though. Needs some time. Better after 2011, but not a longterm ager.",88,70,California
25480,France,"This is the second wine of Vieille Cure, one of the leading Fronsac estates. It is aging well, moving from fruit to mature, secondary flavors, softening in the process. Wood aging has balanced the blackberry fruit with spice and made it ready to drink.",89,17,Bordeaux
25490,US,"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved.",89,40,California
25500,Portugal,"Gentle wood aging has given this single-vineyard wine its smooth texture. At three-years-old, it is ripe, balanced and rounded. The juicy red fruits are already delicious, juicy and full of bright flavors. It is ready to drink.",88,12,D?o
25510,US,"This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.",86,25,California
25520,US,"Fermented in stainless steel, this medium-bodied wine is supple in nutty pear and fig, as well as viscous in honey. Serve chilled with chicken-lemongrass banh mi.",86,24,California
25530,Argentina,"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.",85,13,Mendoza Province
25540,US,"Pale yellow pink in color, this is one of the better rosés of the vintage, showing lush but restrained aromas of peach crème fra?che along with lemon zest and crushed limestone. There is fabulous energy and texture on the sip, where chalky flavors meet with red apple and a hint of rosewater.",92,25,California
25550,US,"Lush cassis aromas are cut by black pepper and charcoal on the nose of this bottling by Las Vegas sommelier-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri, who was raised in Rome. It's still young and tightly wound on the palate, but slowly unfurls boisterous blackberry fruit, thyme and pepper, with sticky firm tannins and a strong acidity from front to back.",92,46,California
25560,US,"Light and chalky aromas of lemon peel, yeast and white flowers are pure and inviting on the nose of this bottling by regional sparkling pioneer Norm Yost. Clean lines of lime peel and rounded hints of nectarine show on the very pleasing and non-aggressive palate.",92,40,California
25570,Chile,"Gritty white-fruit and green aromas are more neutral than loud. This has a sharp, citric mouthfeel that's all about acidity. Tart flavors of citrus and mixed greens finish salty.",85,17,Chile
25580,Spain,"Heavy oak gives off sawmill aromas, with only touches of apple and stone-fruit scents lurking below the surface. This feels creamy, heavy and striving for balance. With a ton of oak flavor leading the charge, it tastes woody, candied and spicy, but also jumbled and unfamiliar.",85,80,Northern Spain
25590,Italy,"Charred earth, toast and menthol aromas come together in this evolved wine. The palate is dried out, showing licorice and powdered sage notes alongside worn tannins.",85,,Piedmont
25600,US,"From an estate property, this is among the winery's top bottlings every year. In this stellar vintage it shows well in a mix of cranberry and dense earth. Tightly wound and still a touch chewy in tannin weight, the oak is present yet integrated, allowing the ripe fruit to shine.",90,69,California
25610,France,"Earth and smoke join fruity, fresh apples on the nose. The palate is equally apple-fruited and very appetizing, full of freshness and friendly fruit on a dry, slender body. The juicy, poised cleanliness lingers beautifully.",90,42,Alsace

25630,US,"From a cool appellation, a wine that smells bright and clean, like the scent you get when slicing into a fresh peach. There's also a lot of young, toasty oak riding on top of the fruit. Long in the mouth and in the finish, this delicious wine has crisp, supporting acids.",91,35,California
25640,Spain,"Sweet and plump in the nose, with a hint of caramel corn, burnt sugar and char. Flavors of walnuts, dried apricots and citrus peel carry the palate, while the lasting and tasty finish delivers the works in terms of toffee, mocha and raisins. More fruity than many, with a touch of mushroom.",90,14,Andalucia
25650,US,"Almost always distinctive, and this year has unusual flair and finesse. Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards.",90,20,California
25660,France,"Young and fruity, this wine can be enjoyed now for its fruitiness or aged over 2?? years. The attractive black-currant flavor is pleasant now.",84,,Bordeaux
25670,France,"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink.",84,20,Bordeaux
25680,US,"Lots of ripe, pleasurable flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, plums and oak in this dry, nicely structured Cabernet. It's pretty tannic, though, with a tough astringency, and doesn't have the fruit to outlast the tannins over time, so give it a decant and drink soon.",88,23,California
25690,Argentina,"A big wine that handles its 15.3% abv. Smells of pastry, earth and soft berry fruit. Feels round but reticent, with no fire or heat but plenty of blackberry, molasses and coffee. Mellow, toasty and blackened on the finish, with an earthy feel and a baked aftertaste.",88,15,Mendoza Province
25700,US,"A dark, brooding showcase of many of Shake Ridge Vineyards's finest varieties mixed into one inviting bottle. With 31% Syrah, 28% Primitivo, 18% Petite Sirah, 10% Mourvèdre, 7% Malbec and 6% Merlot, this wine has baked plum and dark bright cherry predominantly, followed by a grip of tobacco and cinnamon spice. Have it with roasted meat and potatoes.",88,28,California
25710,US,"Concentrated black fruit flavors are pleasant but obscured by generous oak treatment and slightly confectionery flavors of cherry vanilla and mocha chocolate. Hints of tree bark and green, vinous flavors peep through cream and vanilla notes on the midpalate.",84,30,New York
25720,Portugal,"A soft and fruity wine, with raspberry and caramel flavors. It is attractively lightened by acidity and give a soft, off-dry aftertaste.",84,9,Tejo
25730,Portugal,"A curious wine that has little connection with Pinot Noir tastes. It has red fruits, hints of cherry, but for the rest is an attractive red wine and no more.",84,35,Duriense
25740,Austria,"Earth, yeast, ripe red apples and some oaky spice defy expectations. A little bit funky but endlessly intriguing, this wine will complement food, especially if there are mushrooms and bitter leaves. The soft and concentrated palate is rich but does not lack in refreshment. A spike of spearmint keeps you coming back.",91,,Burgenland
25750,Portugal,"As with other wines from Quinta do Cardo, this is packed with minerals and a dark, stony texture. It is concentrated, full of intense acidity and powerful tannins. Rich, it conveys a genuine sense of aging potential. Don't drink before 2018.",91,16,Beira Interior
25760,US,"Fragrant and inviting in dark cherry, raspberry and cola spice, this medium-weight Pinot Noir is lush and meaty. Bright flavors veer from dark cherry to raspberry, with a pronounced lift of earth and herb. The wine is layered, beautifully textured and long in the finish.",91,44,California
25770,France,"Shining bright fruits give this wine a freshly polished character that glows with red berries and acidity. It's a textured wine, full of minerality as well as a steely edge. The aftertaste is lively and bright.",87,16,Provence
25780,France,"As pale as a rosé can be, this is a smooth and rounded wine. Ripe, perfumed red fruits offer a tang from a squeeze of lemon. The acidity gives the right amount of freshness to this attractive, drink-it-now wine.",87,20,Provence
25790,Italy,"This blend of Sangiovese and Alicante Bouschet holds savory aromas of grilled herb, toast, black fruit, earth and flint.

25800,Italy,"Fresh, alluring aromas of wild berry, pressed violet, dark baking spice and a whiff of new leather all come together in the glass.

25830,US,"This Riesling is right on the borderline of dry/off-dry (just under 1% RS). The fruit, from cooler Willamette Valley vineyard sites, has been fermented in stainless steel and aged on its lees, yielding a wine that is thick, almost meaty. It's as sappy as a fresh peach, and finishes with crisp peach-skin phenolics. All-in-all this is a surprising wine, neither simple nor plain, but full-flavored in the comforting style that seems almost to have vanished from the Northwest.",89,14,Oregon
25840,Australia,"A warm, inviting wine, with scents of brown sugar, plum and baking spices. The tannins are creamy-soft, imparting a lush texture, balanced by just enough acidity to keep it from being thick or cloying. Finishes with plenty of fruit, plus a dash of chocolate.",88,14,South Australia

25860,Spain,"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body.",88,20,Catalonia

25910,Portugal,"There is much of the perfumed character of Touriga Nacional in this wine that goes with the ripe, juicy black fruits and acidity. At this stage, there is a strong spice from the wood aging and this needs to soften before the wine will be ready to drink. Wait until 2018.",87,15,Alentejano
25920,US,"Canned peach, banana and lilting white-flower aromas show some good concentration on the nose. The palate is playful and textured, with a pop of tropical fruit on the entry and more florals on the midpalate. A peach-fuzz texture tingles on the close.",87,18,Texas

It's polished and delicious.",93,45,Northeastern Italy
25970,US,"Bradley Brown's Syrah magic shines again on this wine from a vineyard planted 2,300 feet over the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The wine is redolent on the nose, with black pepper, crushed violet and salted pork. It pulls a tannic punch to the mouth once sipped, with blackberry, leather, heavy-duty tar and persistent pepper. Decant for maximum flavor extraction.",92,48,California
25980,US,"This is a curious but successful blend of basically equal parts Zinfandel, Malbec and Tannat. Rich aromas of blackberry and blueberry meet with pine, cigar box and wet rocks on the nose. The berry fruit that shows first on the sip is elevated by a woody backbone and lifted with crushed clove.",91,48,California
25990,US,"From a 30-year-old vineyard planted to historic cuttings of the grape, this wine has an inviting nose that shows fresh strawberry-hibiscus juice mixed with marjoram, mint and light cedar. The palate packs in all that's wondrous about Cab Franc, highlighting oregano, thyme, bay leaf, leather and peppercorn against a backdrop of boysenberry and elderberry fruit.",91,45,California
26000,US,"This is a dark, black and brooding wine, full bodied and firmly impacted in tannin. Mountain sage, currant and mocha highlight dense ripe fruit and dustiness that linger with a spiciness of clove on the finish.",91,110,California
26010,US,"The light and fruity flavors of young vines dominate here, tart and sharp in this cool vintage. Raspberry and light herb open into a delicate, short, somewhat attenuated wine.",86,50,Oregon

26040,Spain,"Funky aromas of wet dog, grapy berry fruits and hickory are sketchy. This feels more baked and flat than lively, while flavors of oaky, creamy berry fruits are mildly green. A thick, oaky finish is more gummy than fresh.",84,20,Northern Spain
26050,Spain,"Herbal, peppery aromas of tomato and green herbs are sketchy. This feels raw, juicy and citric, while flavors of briny, peppery, lightly bitter citrus fruits end similarly. This is made entirely from the Trepat grape.",84,15,Catalonia
26060,France,This Alliance Bourg wine is dry and firm with its concentrated tannins. Too much extraction has left a bitter character. It will remain a wine that is tough.,84,22,Bordeaux
26070,US,"This feels bone dry and tannic, and it has a ripe core of blackberry, mulberry and raisin flavors, with some bitterness on the finish. It is a sturdy wine, and while it's not an ager, it will pair well with rich barbecue.",87,32,California

26100,France,"A finely structured, delicate, elegant wine, this has a pure white fruit and mineral character that lies easily on the palate. The aftertaste is soft but there is still a steely edge to the wine, which promises long aging. Give it at least 5 years.",91,72,Champagne
26110,US,"The vineyard, on Spring Mountain, has been the source of very good Cabs from both Marston and Beringer, and the '04 continues that tradition. Made in the modern style, this is soft and very ripe to the point of sweetness. But it pulls back at the last minute, allowing the cassis, chocolate and red cherry flavors to finish dry. Best with something simple, like a grilled steak.",91,90,California
26120,Italy,"Sweet oak-driven notes of vanilla, chocolate and spice shape a modern Taurasi with a soft and supple side. The wine is dense and chewy with thick, dark tannins and loads of mineral intensity to fuel a long-lasting finish.",90,49,Southern Italy
26130,US,"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is from Jess Jackson-owned vineyards high above Alexander Valley. Made solidly in the modern style, it's very ripe, very soft, and extraordinarily rich in chocolate-infused cassis, cherry, date and violet flavors that are liberally treated with new oak. It's a delicious, seductive wine that should ride out the next 8 years with ease.",90,70,California
26140,Italy,"I Capitani, a dynamic family-run winery not far from Taurasi, opts for a traditional wine that puts more emphasis on elegance and complexity and less focus on brawn and power. Aromas include cherry, cola, tar, licorice and red apple. The wine is already a bit brownish on its edges, so don't wait long to drink it.",89,39,Southern Italy
26150,Italy,"Made with Nerello Mascalese, this opens with aromas of flint, ripe orchard fruit and a whiff of baked bread. The dry palate shows red apple, flint, lemon drop and Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a persistent, elegant perlage.",89,45,Sicily & Sardinia
26160,US,"Juicy fruit flavors carry a pleasantly candied character, dappled with hints of cinnamon and pepper flakes. It's broad and appealing, with a touch of mint enlivening the finish.",89,18,Oregon

26180,Italy,"Barolo Parafada is a very ripe expression of Nebbiolo with thick aromas of chocolate, raspberry, blueberry jam and cola that suggest hot growing conditions. The wine does have balance and structure though, especially in the mouth where firm tannins leave a lasting impression.",89,78,Piedmont
26190,Italy,"Earthy mineral tones are backed by blackberry, licorice, cassis and currant berries to shape an intense but traditional Barbaresco. The mouthfeel is smooth yet firm and compact thanks to the solid nature of its tannins. Drink this wine no later than 2018.",89,48,Piedmont
26200,France,"This wine is full of rich fruit. With apricots, mangos and a layer of caramel, this is a generous wine with enough acidity to sustain its richness. The aftertaste brings in spice, vanilla and a squeeze of lemon.",88,24,Burgundy

26240,US,"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",90,28,California
26250,US,"Hogue's Genesis bottling is far more limited than the winery's other Rieslings, and offers extra dimensions in terms of concentration and grip. Though just 12.6% alcohol, it tastes dry enough, with juicy acidity and green apple flavors. What elevates it above the less expensive bottling is its length, the minerality and the hints of white flower, Mandarin orange and stone.",90,16,Washington
26260,US,"High in perceptible acidity, this wine leans savory in rhubarb, cranberry and a twist of sour cherry, adding in clove and black pepper behind the scenes. Light-bodied, it's soft and table-ready.",88,40,California
26270,US,"A year older than the Riboli family's higher-end San Simeon brand, this bargain bottling is a steal for the oft-ridiculed vintage. Dense elderberry fruit, smoked cedar and dried oregano show on the nose, while the palate is complex and herbacesously Bordelaise in style, with oregano, thyme and dill giving nuance to tart blueberries and black plum fruit.",88,20,California
26280,US,"Merlot makes up three quarters of this wine with the rest Cabernets Franc (17%) and Sauvignon.

The cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet, with rustic tannins backing them up.",88,24,Washington
26290,US,"Softly delicious, this is a beautiful Merlot to drink now. It's a little hot in alcohol on the finish, but feels elegant in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, currants and mocha.",87,35,California
26300,Italy,"Fresh citrus and stone fruit give this Soave Classico a very bright and lively feel. It's an easy, food-freindly wine produced in the informal but cheerful style that characterizes this white wine region in northern Italy.",87,22,Veneto
26310,US,"Robust and rustic, this is a full-bodied Italian-inspired red blend, indicative of its varieties which range from Carignane and old-vine Zinfandel to old-vine Petite Sirah, Mataro, old-vine Black Malvasia and Alicante Bouschet. It's old-school in every way, with flavors that tend toward dark cherry, licorice and leather.",87,28,California
26320,US,"Fresh-cut grass and gooseberry dominate on the nose of this wine, a style that's not for everyone. From there, bristling sparks of lemon and lime dominate, giving the wine a refreshing edge. Unoaked, the finish is a tad severe in its austerity.",86,24,California
26330,France,"This wine just avoids an excessive amount of wood. Instead the wood flavors enhance the black-plum and berry fruits. It is a dry wine, dense and firm. It does need time, so wait until 2018.",86,,Bordeaux
26340,US,"Savory notes of nuts and grains stand out against a backdrop of fresh white grapefruit, apple and lemon in this semidry Riesling. Crisp lime acidity lends refreshment to the finish. Drink now.",86,17,New York

26360,France,"With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive. Behind the fruitiness, there is a firm, structured character of minerality and a steely edge, which makes this a Chardonnay to age for 3?? years.",90,65,Burgundy
26370,US,"Cellar this young wine for 5?? years to let it mellow. Right now, it's aggressive in tannins and acids. The core of cherry, black raspberry, rhubarb and plum flavors is strong, which suggests that the wine will age.",90,45,California
26380,Spain,"Another excellent Idus. The nose is jammed full of big berry, leather and earth aromas. In the mouth, it's pure to the hilt, with jammy depth and delicious flavors of blackberry, chocolate and licorice. Finishes toasty and creamy, with soft tannins and ease. Drink now through 2015.",93,50,Catalonia
26390,US,"Held back for nearly four years, this Pinot still brims with acidity. Tartness is the shock that precedes columns of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola, bearing banners of exotic spices. A precise, intellectually pure wine, it should be decanted now, and will develop interestingly over the years.",93,30,California
26400,US,"Elaborately ripe, this polished Pinot explodes with fresh flavors of raspberries and cherries that taste pie-baked, with the smoky, sweet, toasty crust. It's just delicious, and also obviously fruity-sweet, with a jammy attractiveness. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in richness. Drink now.",92,37,California
26410,France,"Initially rough around the edges, this wine opens up to give warm red berry fruits, firm tannins and a solid structure. Underlying tannins give a dry core. A more juicy, fresh aftertaste means this wine needs some aging. Drink from 2017.",88,25,Bordeaux
26420,US,"A for effort, B for delivery on this 100% Cabernet. It shows those famous Howell Mountain tannins, and the flavors are concentrated in blackberries and black currants. An elusive minerality gives the mouthfeel a hard, stony resistance, beyond the tannins. It doesn't seem likely that the fruit will outlast the hardness, so drink up, after a long time in the decanter.",88,60,California
26430,France,"Big, juicy and smoky, this powerful wine comes from vines in the center of the vineyard. Black fruits and firm tannins dominate the richness of the wine with its dark structure and concentration. A touch of chocolate and licorice partners with the generous fruits. Drink from 2024.",94,299,Burgundy
26440,US,"Seductive ripe, oaky and almost sweet flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to love. The plump blackberry and boysenberry flavors coat the palate while hints of nutmeg and vanilla spice up the aromas and continue through the finish. Concentration and a sense of layering close the deal.",94,36,California
26450,US,"Great aromatic complexity and richly layered fruit flavors propel this full-bodied, sophisticated and deep wine.

26460,Chile,"Blackberry and cola aromas are cool and collected. The palate has weight and texture to accompany berry, mint, herb and peppery flavors. Turns more herbal and roasted as it unwinds. Pepper and spice lead the finish.",88,24,Colchagua Valley

26520,US,"This is the producer's inaugural offering of the variety, made in tiny amounts, but boy oh boy, it's good. Bright blue and black-berry succulence exude vibrancy and freshness on the palate complemented by savory hints of tar, black licorice and char. Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak.",93,75,California
26530,France,"The wine comes from the C?te de Py, regarded as the finest site in Morgon. It has produced a rich mineral-textured wine. The structure is balanced by fine acidity and generous fruitiness. Red berries and cherry flavors are sustained by the firm tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019.",93,50,Beaujolais
26540,US,"This small, estate-grown red from the eastern edge of St. Helena shows meticulous care taken both in the vineyard and cellar, with its remarkably soft, integrated tannin, especially in this warm, ripe vintage. Given just 2% Petit Verdot, it shines in black pepper, black cherry and a tiny suggestion of vanilla.",93,95,California
26550,US,"Big, robust and powerful, this inky wine has wonderfully complex and assertive flavors, along with a thick, velvety and tannic texture. Flavors of espresso, dark chocolate and blueberries rush across the palate, linger in the chewy texture and last on the long finish. A bit bold to fully enjoy now, this will be best after 2019.",92,25,California
26560,Austria,"Ripe Concord pear informs the nose and palate. This is gentle and smooth, elegant and fine-boned—yet there is a juicy, ripe core brightened by citrus freshness that makes this a real tonic of a wine. Lovely and full of charm, with a masterfully light touch.",92,36,Kremstal
26570,Italy,"Made with dried grapes??5% Malvasia delle Lipari and 5% Corinto Nero—this opens with delicate aromas of dried stone fruit, walnut and a hint of sweet spice.

26580,US,"Light aromas of spice, yellow apple and butter are followed by viscous, sweet fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal.",86,12,Washington
26590,US,"There's a diluted nature to this wine, from a selection of varietal clones. Dry, it holds back on flavor, delivering a light texture and soft red-fruit flavors.",86,25,California
26600,Spain,"Earthy cherry aromas are leathery as well. A dry, high-acid palate is grabby and fairly sharp in texture. Raw, salty flavors of plum and wood spice finish with tough, drying tannins.",86,13,Northern Spain
26610,Croatia,"A whopping 15.1% abv, this Plavac Mali (an ancestor of Zin) is certainly on the big and brawny side, but also reveals a complexity that evolves dramatically in the glass. Aromas of sun-dried hay and grass are prevalent through the nose and palate, adding a rustic quality to the sweet and spicy red fruit, fig and toast characteristics. The long finish is marked by an assertive show of tannins.",89,45,Peljesac
26620,Italy,"Brichet is a soft and plump Barbera with loads of red cherry, chocolate fudge and cinnamon. It's fun, rich and easy to drink. Pair it with meatloaf or lamb chops.",89,35,Piedmont

26650,US,"This is a rare, 100% varietal, single-vineyard Malbec. It downright dazzles with notes of dark plum and spice that are followed by seamless, pure, elegant fruit flavors.",91,32,Washington
26660,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.",93,35,California
26670,US,"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds.",93,45,Washington
26680,France,"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.",91,90,Burgundy
26690,US,"Full-bodied and rich, this slightly orange-colored bubbly offers forward flavors of cherry vanilla and Chardonnay with mashed ripe strawberries. It's very good, an addictively drinkable bubbly that finishes clean, dry and yeasty.",91,27,California

Rose petals, pencil lead, thyme and oregano add nuance.",92,26,California

26800,US,"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years.",90,33,Oregon
26810,US,"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.",90,40,Oregon
26820,Portugal,"With just the right black currant character, this is a rich, structured wine. It has weight and richness of course, but it is the solid tannins and tight texture that distinguish it. The wine is not quite ready to drink, so wait until 2017.",90,45,Alentejano
26830,Italy,"This wine opens with aromas of blue flower, mature black fruit, vanilla, cake spices and toasted sensations. The dense palate delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla, plum, oak and bracing tannins. It lacks freshness and essential energy, so enjoy over the next few years.",87,47,Tuscany
26840,Italy,"The wine leads off with aromas of mint, spearmint, espresso, oak and red berries. The palate shows cherry, coffee, cooking spices and espresso alongside drying wood tannins. It lacks the fruit richness and structure that one expects from Brunello.",87,50,Tuscany
26850,US,"Richness and breadth are the strong suits of this full-bodied, deep-colored and ripe-tasting wine. Showing little oak character, it smells like blackberries and tastes like black cherries and clove. Moderate tannins balance against the fruitiness.",90,38,California
26860,Italy,"Elegant and fresh, this lovely sparkler opens with aromas of white spring flower, white stone fruit and a whiff of pastry. The silky, vibrant palate delivers crisp apple, pear, citrus and a mineral note alongside firm acidity and an elegant perlage.",90,,Piedmont
26870,France,Very faint notes of red berry are supported by floral overtones on the nose. The palate has pleasantly bitter elements that enhance the yeasty notes of bread crust. The body remains light while the finish is dry and balanced.,89,,Alsace
26880,US,"Dilute and slightly bitter, this does not reflect the warm near-perfect 2014 vintage. Thin generic red fruit comes and goes quickly, with earthy, stemmy tannins left to finish.",82,25,Oregon
26890,US,"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",98,250,California
26900,Austria,"The merest touch of tropicality, of ripe passion fruit, hovers on the nose before lemon and orange kick in. The palate still has an edge of reduction but that is a good and reassuring sign. There is a rich core of ripe poised fruit: tangerine and aromatic oranges are firmly held with grapefruit freshness. There is a beautiful juxtaposition of generosity and tangy freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and utterly fresh—that rich core of fruit invites you to sip and explore again and again.",95,51,Kremstal
26910,US,"Acidic and minty, this Pinot Noir just doesn't have enough richness, despite some modest cherry and cola flavors. Its dry and silky qualities are pleasant.",83,21,California
26920,US,"With an off-putting orange color, this Rh?ne-style blend seems sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors.",82,16,California
26930,Chile,"The nose introduces aromas of vanilla wafer and vegetable. This wine feels flabby and uncommitted, with bitter flavors of white fruit, green banana and white pepper. It is neither interesting nor exciting.",82,12,Maule Valley
26940,France,A ripe red-fruit note offers a perfumed character to this fruity wine. A touch of banana is the only quibble with what is otherwise a bright selection.,87,22,Beaujolais
26950,Italy,"Falanghina  and Coda di Volpe are blended to produce a rich and creamy white with apple, pear and stone fruit. It only sees stainless steel and this helps maintain its fresh fruit flavors.",87,14,Southern Italy
26960,Italy,"Lamùri shows a food friendly side of Nero d'Avola that would pair with veal, pork or roasted turkey. The bouquet is redolent of cherry cola, forest fruit, ginger and toasted nut. Subtle notes of smoke and spice appear on the finish.",87,20,Sicily & Sardinia
26970,New Zealand,"One of NZ's first Sauvignon producers has turned out a commendable wine in 2009, offering classic grassy-herbal aromas and expressive pineapple and herb flavors. It's crisply focused and tight, just falling off a little on the finish. Drink now.",87,12,Marlborough
26980,US,"A very dry, acidic, rather severe Pinot Noir, made in a tighter, leaner style than most. If you find California Pinot too fruity, you'll like the streamlined raspberry, pepper and mineral flavors.",87,30,California
26990,US,"Enormously rich and ripe with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, gingerbread and caramel, this Malbec-based blend has soft, complex tannins. Its best opened soon, to drink with beef dishes.",87,38,California
27000,US,"This reserve bottling takes the winery's basic 2011 Chardonnay and elevantes it with rich fruit and oak flavors. It's flamboyant in style with buttered toast, lemon custard, papaya and vanilla bean flavors, but balanced with good acidity.",87,40,California
27010,US,"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon. It has delicious flavors of cherries and pomegranates, along with earthier notes of ripe heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms splashed with Balsamic.",87,25,California
27020,US,"Blackberry, rose petal and espresso combine for a relatively light aromatic profile in this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot. A cedar flavor dominates the palate, lending structure and depth to blackberry fruit and black pepper spice.",88,40,California
27030,US,"This blends 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Syrah to create a juicy expression of both varieties. Cassis, vanilla and blackberry notes show both aromatically and in flavor, as the wine builds in depth and concentration.",88,55,California
27040,Italy,"Tropical fruit, citrus and white almond scents lead the nose. On the tangy palate, oak hints underscore grapefruit, juicy yellow peach and dried herb flavors, with a candied note of lemon drop.",88,16,Veneto
27050,US,"Winemaker Trey Fletcher is creating texturally tantalizing wines that are exciting to sip now but built to last for years in the cellar. This shows lemon blossom, lemon skin, almond and macadamia scents, with a chalky minerality that's evident even on the nose. Racy, laser-focused acidity frames the palate, where lime, grapefruit and apple flavors unfold. Drink now through 2024.",94,45,California
27060,Portugal,"Dark gold in color, this Port relishes its age. Like an aged tawny, it has lost its fruit at this mature stage, while gaining the rich, intense character that comes from long wood aging. It has concentrated acidity and a long, lingering aftertaste. Drink now.",94,89,Port
27070,US,"This power-packed blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec offers superripe cassis, fudge, vanilla bean and burnt coffee aromas. That coffee element carries over to the lush and softly structured palate, melding with blueberry, caramel and pork fat flavors, a meaty spice note adding to the deliciousness.",94,65,California
27080,US,"Good, but a bit tough and gritty, with a hard edge of tannins. On the other hand there also is dryness and extremely ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, as well as sweet oak. Not showing well now, but could benefit from some years in the cellar.",85,41,California
27090,US,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",84,38,Washington
27100,US,"Dry and firmly tannic, this Cab has upfront flavors of black currants, plums, mocha and cedary oak. There's some sharpness in the texture that limits ageability, but it's a pretty wine for now.",84,25,California
27110,France,"Almost woody in character, this wine has not succeeded in aging gracefully. It is beginning to dry out and lose its fruit. The wine is interesting, not more.",83,29,Loire Valley
27120,Portugal,"The wine is structured, flavored with the wood aging as much as the fruit. It has a spicy burnt character that contrasts with the more juicy black currant flavors. Drink from 2017.",87,15,Tejo
27130,Australia,"Pie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose, followed by tart flavors bundled in a mocha-tinged wrapper. The texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate, but turns dry and dusty on the finish. This is a bit disjointed at this stage, so perhaps it will improve with cellaring. Try after 2018.",87,65,Tasmania
27140,France,"This is a soft, open wine, lightly flavored with red fruits and with attractive acidity. A bright, lively mousse gives a lift to the palate, finishing with an orange-zest tang.",87,35,Champagne
27150,France,"A blend of Syrah, Carignan, Mourvèdre and Grenache, all in even proportion, this is a lush and dense selection that offers upfront notes of wild blackberry, boysenberry, licorice and sweet spice. The palate is lush and the texture creamy, with medium tannins and lovely chocolate and toasted-oak accents that linger long on the finish.",89,24,Languedoc-Roussillon
27160,US,"What a nice Merlot, Brander's best yet. It's easy to drink now for the rich array of cherries, currants, cola, smoked meat and cedar, brightened with brisk acidity. But give it an hour or two in the decanter to soften and mellow.",89,22,California
27170,Italy,"This has subtle aromas of blackberry, pepper and tilled earth. The palate delivers a core of plum, blackcherry and licorice, uplifted with white pepper and orange zest accents. Its refreshing acidity makes it enjoyable now, but will also allow it to age modestly. Drink after 2016.",89,16,Veneto
27180,Portugal,"A wood-aged wine, with ripe yellow fruits, spice and a smooth, creamy character, kept firmly in place by apple skin texture and a flinty edge.",90,,Douro
27190,Portugal,"The second wine produced by the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto and the Cazes of Ch?teau Lynch-Bages. It is rich, hugely spiced, with violet aromas and black currant fruits, a leathery edge to the texture. The alcohol leaves a slight burn, which blows off.",90,,Douro
27200,France,"Well-balanced wine, ripe fruit, touches of wood, light spice, ginger and sweet apples. Structured, held well together by wood.",90,28,Burgundy
27210,US,"Rather lean aromas and spare fruit flavors meet more lavishly rich flavors for dual personalities in this medium-bodied, soft-textured and slightly sweet wine.",83,14,California
27220,US,"While its forward, fruity aromas are inviting, intensely candied notes of cherry cough syrup and strawberry jello lend a confected feel to this Syrah. The palate is sharp and thin, with a modest finish.",83,19,New York
27230,Chile,"Bland, midland aromas of dusty apple land on vegetal after this airs out. A flat, no-spine palate and green flavors of tropical fruits and vegetables end with green-herb notes of thyme and tarragon.",82,8,Central Valley
27240,US,"With its dried herb, parsley, cherry and spice aromas, this could only be Cabernet Sauvignon. Its cherry and raspberry flavors are bright yet subtle, carrying long into the finish.",90,50,Washington
27250,Spain,"Initial murky aromas clear up while remaining a bit gritty and stalky. This crianza has a raw, choppy feel. Gritty, earthy flavors of leathery plum and berry fruits finish peppery and spicy. Drink through 2022.",90,29,Northern Spain
27260,US,"Attractive roasted, smoky aromas join ripe plum and blackberry flavors in this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. It's a great value and packs plenty of fruitiness into a rather big, moderately tannic frame.",90,13,California
27270,US,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",92,24,Oregon
27280,Portugal,"Deep, black-colored wine, firm, serious and still young. It has power and concentration, dark berry fruits, herbal and spice flavors and a core of wood. This is a wine for long-term aging to soften the tannins.",92,52,Douro
27290,New Zealand,"Despite its low alcohol level, this is an attractively plump, medium-bodied wine, marked by a harmonious kaleidoscope of fruit. Passion fruit, nectarine and pink grapefruit all make appearances before vanishing a bit quickly on the finish.",88,18,Marlborough
27300,Spain,"Peach, melon, citrus and yeasty notes define the nose on this dry brut nature. This offers good texture, fluffy carbonation and citrusy acidity in front of papaya, dry mango, nectarine and peach flavors. The finish is fruity in flavor and citrusy in feel.",88,35,Catalonia
27310,US,"Niner's Paso Robles Bordeaux-style reds have attracted attention. Now the winery turns to Pinot Noir, but they wisely turn to the cooler Edna Valley. The resulting wine is dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with pleasant raspberry and sandalwood flavors.",88,35,California
27320,US,"This new offering is light and elegant, with tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. There's an herbal edge to the wine, all in proportion, with generous acidity that could reward a few more years in the bottle.",89,60,Oregon
27330,France,"With its honeyed aromas, this is a warm and rich wine. It has some ripe, buttery flavors alongside more fruity apples and pears. It is smoothly textured, feeling ripe and ready to drink by 2015.",89,,Burgundy
27340,Germany,"Equal parts earth and fruit, this full-bodied Riesling offers loads of penetrating melon, citrus and honey flavors offset by delicate tones of saffron and dusty mineral. Dry in style and struck by exhilarating acidity, it offers exceptional balance and complexity.",93,40,Mosel
27350,France,Ripe pear is bathed in honey on the nose and palate of this wine. There is a touch of pleasant bitterness reminiscent of fir honey. All this is countered by lemon zest freshness that brightens and lightens and brings beautiful balance and poise. The finish is moreish and refreshing. Drink 2017??030.,93,70,Alsace
27360,US,"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day.",93,55,California
27370,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",85,13,Northern Spain
27380,France,"A simple, rounded wine, soft and fruity. Pear and apricot flavors dominate along with a crisper, grapefruit edge. The wine is aging quickly, and will be ready in a few months.",86,21,Burgundy
27390,US,"Lean and tough, but not without a certain charm, this Cab's blackberry and currant flavors are wrapped in hard, edgy tannins. The sweet core of fruit will wake up when paired with rich beef dishes.",86,28,California
27400,US,"There's a strong dose of green gooseberry in this wine that makes it distinct, although you'll also find riper notes of limes and grapefruits. It's quite dry and crisp with acidity, finishing with mouthwatering tartness.",86,23,California
27410,US,"It doesn't say so on the label, but this is 100% Syrah. It's massively rich and extracted in cherries and blackberries, with smooth tannins and a fine burst of acidity. Give it 5?? years to let everything begin to knit together.",91,68,California
27420,US,"An aromatically brooding wine with notes of cherry, black pepper and barrel spices. It's full bodied with rich flavors and a cranberry lick on the finish.",91,38,Washington
27430,US,"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows a nice interplay of fruit and barrel with notes of cocoa, cherry, dry chocolate and toast supported by well-integrated tannins. The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",91,40,Washington
27440,US,"A super-dark, well integrated, gamy, ripe and tannic Malbec that opens well and dives straight into savory and peppery characteristics. The wine is an interesting, fruit-forward version of California Malbec from a vineyard more known for Cabernet Sauvignon. Big (15% alcohol) but age-worthy.",90,50,California
27450,Italy,"Give Prapò Barolo a few minutes to open in the glass. As it does, floral aromas evolve into tones of berry fruit, cola and smoked ham. The mouthfeel is compact, firm and crisp with a touch of menthol freshness at the end.",90,,Piedmont
27460,US,"This is a dark and tarry wine, perhaps a tad early for release, showing condensed purple flowers, beef jerky, charcoal and plum peels on the nose. The palate is tart and chewy, with asphalt, sour black fruit and tobacco notes. Wait a year and this may sing much more strongly.",86,35,California
27470,France,"The Négrette wines come mainly from a small area northwest of Toulouse although they are also found in pockets elsewhere in the southwest. This is a light and deliciously fruity wine, full of rosewater aromas and a bright aftertaste.",86,11,France Other
27480,US,"Big, hearty fruit flavors and full body without a lot of tannin make this wine appealing and a good match for meaty dishes from carne asada burritos to pot roast. It's probably no coincidence considering the brand name that it has lots of oak flavor, adding vanilla and other spices.",86,24,California
27490,New Zealand,"A sizable 70,000 cases of this bargain were imported, so it should be reasonably available. The citrus fruit does have a greenish tinge to it, boasting hints of passion fruit, snap pea and green onion, but they're within the bounds of regional typicity, and bring a crisp, tart edge to the finish. Drink now.",89,14,Marlborough
27500,US,"High-toned acidity lends verve to delicate raspberry and white grapefruit flavors here. It's not deeply concentrated but lavishly textured with a cutting, mineral finish. Drink now.",89,22,New York
27510,Austria,"This wine's nose gives little more than a suggestion of zesty ripeness. The palate, on the other hand, is full of friendly, lively fruit. Crisp green and yellow apple and ripe citrus pervade its slender but joyful frame. Zesty and fresh, it only faintly hints of the variety's usual nuttiness.",89,21,Burgenland
27520,US,"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age. Give it two or three years to soften, and let the blackberry, cherry and coffee fruit emerge from the tannins.",88,20,California
27530,Germany,"This medium-bodied kabinett features an appealing lushness to its texture—it's not a slim, racy wine but instead offers hints of honey and diesel oil balanced by ripe apples and citrus. Drink now.",88,19,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
27540,Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",87,49,Northern Spain
27550,France,"This is a finely structured wine that will age well. With black-plum fruits, layers of dark young tannins and balanced acidity, it is both juicy and full of great ripe swathes of fruit. From the cru estate that is owned by Louis Jadot in Beaune, it is impressive and worth aging. Drink from 2018.",94,28,Beaujolais
27560,Austria,The spicy nose already signals joy: Bosc pear is edged with mandarin and white-pepper spice. The concentrated palate flows with ripe juicy white-fleshed pear fruit but is given direction by gentle ripe citrus freshness and sheer bundling of flavor. There is welcome texture to the midpalate and beautifully penetrating zestiness. The finish is long and very moreish.,94,70,Wachau
27570,Italy,"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with intense aromas of black-skinned fruit, purple flower, oak and exotic spice. The taut, elegant palate offers black currant, black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins. It's still youthfully austere, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020??033.",94,325,Tuscany
27580,Chile,Two samples of this Cabernet were tasted and both are reduced and smell like spray paint. A clampy tannic palate offers stewy black-fruit flavors in front of an overoaked finish. This lacks flow and doesn't seem entirely natural.,82,12,Central Valley
27590,Spain,"Muddled candied aromas smell uniquely unnatural and forced. This is choppy and jagged in the mouth, while a strange set of fake-oak and murky berry flavors are prominently on display.",80,9,Central Spain
27600,Italy,"Red berry, wild mint, crushed rose, forest floor and new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant delicious red. Seamlessly boasting structure and finesse, the full-bodied palate displays layers of succulent morello cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cinnamon while firm velvety tannins lend support and a polished texture. A savory saline note wraps up the lingering finish. Drink 2018??026.",96,45,Tuscany
27610,US,"Sweet, spicy fruit, with nicely matched toasty oak framing it. Everything balances out; this actually has the best balance and most seductive fruit of the three Lolonis bottlings, and certainly represents the best value.",88,20,California
27620,Australia,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich—maybe even fat for Riesling—but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.",88,18,South Australia
27630,France,"Cocoa and cedar aromas dominate the bouquet, but then some dark fruit emerges on the palate. It's dense, rich and flavorful, but lacks the elegance and finesse to score higher.",87,14,Rh?ne Valley
27640,Italy,"Cupinero is a softly oaked red that's immediately likeable. It makes an elegant first impression with sweet cherry, white peppercorn, chocolate and exotic spice. Wood tones are more evident in the mouth, where vanilla and toasted flavors take over. Drink after 2010.",90,40,Tuscany
27650,Italy,"Cabernet Franc is the base of this modern, plush wine with notes of cherry, plum, prune, mature fruit, earth, Porcini mushroom and spicy tobacco. The mouthfeel is elegant and delicate despite the thick extraction.",90,75,Tuscany
27660,Italy,"Volpolo is a big, ripe, succulent wine with ripe fruit and a broad approach. It delivers tones of black cherry, currant berry and spice over a tightly knit structure. You could call it a comfort wine because it is easy and satisfying.",90,45,Tuscany
27670,US,"Oak dominates this wine, with toasty charcoal aromas and flavors. The underlying wine seems pretty simple, with blackberry fruit flavors. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up.",86,60,California
27680,US,An inexpensive Merlot that's herbal. It also shows cranberry and menthol amid a light toasting of oak.,85,15,California
27690,US,"Take a few bucks off the price, and this would be a good value. As things stand, this Chardonnay, which is a blend of Santa Clara Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains fruit, is fairly standard. It's dry and crisp, with pleasant lemon-custard flavors that turn a little unripe on the finish.",85,20,California
27700,US,"A very easy-drinking white from Newsome Harlow that's mostly Muscat Blanc à Petit Grains (75%) with 15% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, whole-cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel. Fermented dry, though the finish definitely veers a tad sweet, the wine is full of aromatic apricot and peach with spice notes throughout, a full body and plenty of acidity.",88,20,California
27710,Chile,"Sweet and oaky, and a little bit forced, but even so this is a natural, full-bodied Chardonnay with a chunky palate and tropical, sweet flavors. As it opens it goes more into the banana, vanilla and papaya field of play, and it finishes decidedly creamy and round. Very good stuff from Tamaya.",88,23,Limarí Valley
27720,US,"An easy to drink white wine, of a style increasingly popular. It's unoaked, allowing pure citrus, honey and spice flavors to star. Brisk Edna Valley acids and minerals make the mouthfeel lively.",87,17,California
27730,US,"Hot in high alcohol, which gives a burn that accentuates the pepper spice and makes it fierce. Yet it's fully dry and rich in blackberry, blueberry, anise and tobacco flavors. Defines the California superripe Zinfandel style.",87,22,California
27740,US,"Broad scents of honeydew, candied lemon and orchard fruit mark the nose, with an underpinning of toasted nut. The palate is medium bodied, with balanced acidity and apple flavor.",85,18,Virginia
27750,Italy,This is a fresh and light Prosecco that puts great emphasis on citrus and grapefruit aromas. Beyond those layers are touches of white flower and peach. Try this wine with a bowl of warm popcorn.,85,13,Veneto
27760,Portugal,"This is a bright, fruity wine, full of acidity and generous red fruit flavors with a soft texture. This will be ready to drink in a year.",85,11,Península de Setúbal
27770,US,"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich.",90,15,Oregon
27780,US,"A great buy in a smooth, dry Merlot that shows real Napa elegance and style. It's medium-bodied and lush, with appealing cherry, currant, licorice, tobacco, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now for the immediate appeal.",90,22,California
27790,US,"Very dark-purple fruit meet with crushed black rocks, dense purple flowers and roasted beef on the nose of this lush and delicious bottling, which is bolstered by bits of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. Soft black cherry, caramel and vanilla flavors coat the palate, with slate, cocoa, espresso bean and graham cracker touches.",94,48,California
27800,US,"This is a very strong showing for a brand new brand, thanks, no doubt, to veteran winemaker Jeff Fink's involvement. Tight on the nose with Meyer lemon pith, savory salts and a waft of oak smoke, the palate explodes with chalky tension and rich yet bright complexity. Flavors of white lily, peach and sea salt ride atop melted butter, leading into a caramelized finish.",94,36,California
27810,US,"Pungent aromas of tight-grained oak meet with almonds, pecans and lemon sorbet on the opulent attention-grabbing nose. Woody flavors of sandalwood and cedar continue to the palate, which is crisp, clean and salty but not unctuous at all, with tangy citrus on the finish.",94,55,California
27820,Italy,"Made with 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Syrah, this has subdued aromas of black-skinned fruit and dark baking spice. The simple palate shows black cherry and a hint of cedar alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",86,16,Tuscany
27830,France,"Produced from Henry Fessy's own cru vineyards, the wine is fruity and very accessible to drink young. Generous berry fruits and soft tannins make this an attractive wine. The aftertaste brings in light acidity. Drink now.",86,20,Beaujolais
27840,US,"Savory, smoky tones lend a shadowy feel to fresh apple and pear flavors in this dry medium-bodied Pinot Gris. It's not deeply concentrated in fruit but refreshing and easy going. Drink now through 2018.",86,16,New York
27850,US,"Lighter in color than many wines from the same appellation, this still packs a complex punch on the nose, with snappy cranberry, crushed slate and peppercorn aromas. The zesty palate conveys baked strawberry, clove and pine forest underbrush flavors.",92,32,California
27860,US,"This bold and flavorful wine has a strong black-tea element in the complex flavors, full body and a smooth, mouthcoating texture. It tastes riper and more roasted or beefy than many of its peers and is compelling for its concentration on the palate and length on the finish.",92,45,California
27870,Spain,"Mineral and citrus aromas are on the money. Peach and citrus flavors are clean and snappy on the palate, finishing with fresh acidity and a reprise of lime and minerally notes.",91,23,Galicia
27880,Austria,"This is a ripe, spicy and pepper-flavored wine. It has pear and green plum notes that give a crisp edge to the rich texture. There is a mineral touch that brings out the acidity to balance the opulence. Age for 2?? years. Screwcap.",89,30,Wachau
27890,Spain,"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15.",89,15,Catalonia
27900,Spain,"Aromas of cedar cigar box, subtle flower, spice and dry berry form a good bouquet. Searing acidity creates some sharpness, while the primary flavors of berry and plum are offset by red tomato and dry spice. Roasted, dry, spicy and slightly bitter on the finish.",89,24,Northern Spain

27980,US,"Rose petals, red currants, red licorice and a bit of snapped sage stick entertain the nose on this bottling, which can be sampled at the producer's downtown Paso tasting room.

28030,US,"While the nose suggests intensely ripe, almost ruddy black plums and cherries, the palate of this full-bodied blend is surprisingly lean.

28080,Chile,"One of Chile's best Malbecs. This vintage is very rich and compact, with blackberry, marzipan and cola aromas. The palate is firm and sturdy, but more like a bench than a plush chair. Superripe and a little clumsy, with really intense cassis and cherry flavors. Fruity almost to the point of being over the top.",88,20,Lontué Valley
28090,Chile,"Toast, coconut and pineapple all work the bouquet. It's zesty and healthy on the palate, with pear, coconut and baked apple flavors.

On the finish is a satisfying streak of black licorice and pepper. Cellar through 2022.",94,46,California
28110,Australia,"With its knockout nose of blackberries and baking spices, this is an instant stunner. It follows that overture with complex flavors in a similar theme.

28210,Argentina,"A neutral nose is the result of oak and mild apple and banana aromas offsetting each other. The palate is fairly forward, with apple, pear and banana flavors. Balance is achieved courtesy of healthy fruit, light oak and good acidity. Don't expect miracles and it should do the trick.",85,16,Mendoza Province
28220,US,"The Naked Riesling is organically farmed and produced. This new vintage already seems a bit tired and has an unusually deep (oxidized?) golden color. It's drinking well enough, like a somewhat aged apple cider, but does not have the sort of freshness that one would hope for in a just-released 2007 wine.",85,12,Washington
28230,France,"A soft wine with flavors of red berries, canned strawberries and a structure that seems more red wine than Champagne. It's a curious hybrid, starting with too much tannin and leaving some astringency. Maybe bottle age will help.",85,200,Champagne
28240,France,"Aromas of green-plum jelly and a touch of toast set out a wine that is spicy as well as fresh. Bitter orange marmalade flavors are laced with lime acidity, lying over a firm, tense structure with a mineral edge. It will develop well, but don't drink before 2020.",93,,Bordeaux

The nose bursts with ripe red fruit and spice—Pinotage hallmarks—and on the palate, lively, spicy and smoky flavors of berry and savory spice abound.

29890,US,"This wine comes from the coolest pocket of the producer's estate, the last part typically picked.

On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes.

30970,Argentina,"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet.

32420,Israel,"Dark violet-red in the glass, this wine's bouquet is marked by notes of black plum and cocoa powder. It is surprisingly bright in the mouth considering its fairly strong tannins, and the fruity flavor profile is dominated by red plum and black cherry with soft spice flourishes. Bright berry notes linger into the finish, matched by equally prominent tannins.",91,35,Galilee
32430,Argentina,"Stony, minerally aromas show a pinch of toast on top of white peach and apple cider scents. On the palate, this stays on the straight and narrow, with high acidity. Clementine and tangerine flavors finish as stony as the name implies; drink this shellfish-friendly, unique Argentinean Chardonnay through 2022.",89,90,Mendoza Province
32440,Italy,"Aromas of red berry, grilled herb and espresso come together on the nose. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, tobacco and mocha alongside dusty, astringent tannins. A licorice note closes the finish.",89,30,Piedmont
32450,Australia,"This blend of 45% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 25% Mourvèdre is full bodied and supple, not heavy or overextracted. Herb notes accent cherry fruit, while hints of mocha creep in on the finish. Enjoy this easy-drinking wine now??017.",89,20,South Australia
32460,France,"A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine.",90,50,Bordeaux
32470,France,"Everything here is just hinted at: a touch of tropical fruit on the nose, a faint note of nougat on the palate and a spritz of lemon over the biscuity backdrop. There is structure, dryness and backbone, all held in a tight package that has a long-echoing aftertaste.",90,29,Alsace
32480,Italy,"Creamy and crisp, this slowly reveals delicate scents of small red berry and Alpine herb. The bright polished palate offers strawberry, apple, nectarine and a hint of bread crust alongside fresh acidity and an elegant mousse. A mineral note backs up the finish.",90,60,Northeastern Italy
32490,Spain,"Intriguing aromas of boysenberry and blueberry come with smoky notes of hickory and aged cheese. This is showing a firm grip on the palate along with ripe, intense flavors of black fruits and prune. On the finish, it's tannic and loaded with licorice and toasty accents. Drink through 2019.",92,27,Central Spain
32500,France,"At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening.",94,80,Bordeaux
32510,France,"Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status.",93,250,Bordeaux
32520,US,"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rh?ne-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency. Airing coaxes out some modest cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and leather flavors, but it will always remain a tough, harsh wine.",84,45,California
32530,US,"Dry and clean, but this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend shows a surprising sharpness and hardness for a wine from this vintage, at this age. The black currant flavors are buried by tannic astringency. Doesn't seem likely to age.",84,48,California
32540,Italy,"One of the standout Amarones from the lovely 2007 vintage, Case Vecie is opulent, rich and impressive in terms of intensity and complexity. It opens with dark, inky concentration and releases a long line of black cherry, spice and soft tobacco flavors. Drink after 2015.",93,80,Veneto
32550,France,"Just slightly richer than the Brut Nature from the same vintage, this Brut is still a wonderfully dry Champagne. It has a fine hint of toasty maturity while the fruit is still full of the crispest citrus flavors. Drink over the next 4?? years.",92,160,Champagne
32560,France,"This wine is fruity with attractive black currants. The tannins are very present, suggesting the wine is young. It is a wine with potential, so drink from 2019.",86,25,Provence
32570,US,"This bottling is very showy on the nose with tons of white flowers, tuberose, guava and mango, though a slice of lime peel cuts the tropicality a bit. Guava peel, feijoa and bitter limes show on the sip, where that slightly treacly tropicality reigns.",86,15,California
32580,US,"Layers of toast, char and dill abound on this oak-driven, full-bodied Chardonnay. There are glimpses of fresh apple and lemon on the palate as well, but they peek through a bit shyly behind a curtain. Further cellaring may help to integrate the oak.",86,25,New York
32590,US,"For such a deep-colored wine, it's the lighter red fruits and minerality that comprise the aromas in this GSM with Petite Sirah. Cranberry and crushed slate rise up most prominently, but the blackberry dominance on the palate better corresponds to the color, and the caramelized finish is a nice touch.",87,48,California
32600,Austria,"A combination of dried white currant, green apple and lemon makes for a refreshing, clean palate with a medium, zesty finish.",87,16,Nieder?sterreich
32610,Italy,"Fermented and aged in barriques, it opens with aromas of oak, toast, butterscotch and apple. Oak dominates the palate, while butter, lemon drop and vanilla mingle in the background.",87,38,Northeastern Italy

32640,Italy,"The clean packaging of this Aglianico rosé from Basilicata is beautiful and so are the wine's delicate aromas of pink grapefruit, raspberry and rose. This is a highly drinkable wine with rich fruit flavors and an easy, no-fuss approach.",87,20,Southern Italy
32650,US,"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced.",87,22,California
32660,US,"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.",87,15,Washington
32670,Italy,"Vincenzo Toffoli's Extra Dry Prosecco delivers a playful touch of sweetness that would pair with salty foods or savory appetizers. The sparkling wine boasts a clear, compact style with a touch of crisp acidity on the close.",87,,Veneto

32690,Argentina,"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.",87,19,Mendoza Province
32700,Portugal,"This wine is firmly tannic, while promising fine fruitiness as it develops. The acidity and black fruits are about to break through the imposing tannic edifice. This wine will be best from 2017.",90,11,Bairrada
32710,France,"This is a wine that varies year by year according to the quality of the harvest. With 2015 a very good vintage in the Southwest, the 100% Duras wine shows well. It's ripe and earthy with sustaining tannins and flavors of ripe plums and rhubarb. It's a wine to age for a few years to soften the tannins and bring it all together. Drink from 2018.",90,18,Southwest France
32720,Italy,"Wild berry, dark baking spice, aromatic herb and espresso aromas are present along with a floral note. The linear palate offers raw red cherry, dried sage and a white pepper note framed in vibrant acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,35,Tuscany
32730,Italy,"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of underbrush, toast, baked plum, nutmeg and mocha. The smooth palate offers dried blackberries, raisins, cocoa, tobacco and ground black pepper. Velvety tannins hold the flavors together. This has reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.",90,45,Tuscany
32740,Spain,"Deep, pure blackberry, cassis and minerally aromas are fresh, clean and authentic for Priorat. This is bold, chunky and ripe, with an acidic streak that maintains clarity. Plum and blackberry flavors are a bit woody and herbal, while pepper, mint, menthol and berry flavors drive a flush, satisfying finish. Drink through 2018.",90,22,Catalonia
32750,France,"The wine comes from a 196-acre property on the first slopes above the Garonne river. Made from the classic Bordeaux blend, it has been aged in wood which gives the intense perfumed, toasty character. The wine is dense, tannic with layers of black fruits. It needs to age more, so drink from 2016.",90,20,Southwest France
32760,US,"This is a pretty basic Zin, fresh and tart in blackberry jam flavor. In its favor, it displays robust full-bodiedness and plenty of Zinny spices. At this price, it's fine with burgers, tacos, ribs.",84,8,California
32770,US,"The Lawrence Vineyard, on the Royal Slope, has proven itself as a source of fine Syrah. This wine does not reflect the quality that the vineyard can produce. It's a thin, tannic wine whose principal flavor seems to be vanilla.",84,25,Washington
32780,US,"There's not a whole lot going on in this basic Pinot Noir, but it does get the idea across of silkiness, dryness, tartness and light-hearted cherry and pomegranate fruit flavors.",84,12,California
32790,US,Aromas of fresh dill and other green herbs leap up from the glass. The plum flavors are pure and persistent. It's a unique expression of the variety.,90,46,Washington
32800,US,"Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure.",90,66,California
32810,France,"From a parcel of 25-year-old vines, this is a concentrated, firm wine that needs to age. It has good potential with its tight, steely character and smoky edge. The fruitiness comes from the organic and biodynamic grapes that give richness as well as a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",90,30,Loire Valley
32820,France,"The berry flavors of this pink fizz are edged with the slightest bitterness. A dry palate brings bright, lemony freshness. Fruit tones are more evident than autolysis, making this for easy-drinking, apéritif fun.",87,25,Alsace
32830,France,"This wine holds the tension between sweetness and fresh apple acidity well. Crisp, light and fruity, it's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink.",87,45,Champagne
32840,France,"Orange-pink in color, this is a fruity while mature wine. It has ripe red berry flavors along with a bitter cherry character that introduces a touch of tannin. The acidity and the crisp aftertaste make for an attractive finish.",87,75,Champagne
32850,France,"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.",89,50,Burgundy
32860,US,"Rich and 100% barrel fermented, this delicious Chardonnay is thick and luscious, with buttered nuts, pineapple and candied citrus; a really concentrated wine with exceptional depth and density for the price. The oak is present and accounted for, but not at all intrusive; it's really a generously fruity wine with a big mid-palate. Outstanding value.",89,18,Washington
32870,US,"A nice Pinot, showing real complexity. Dry and medium-bodied, the wine's acidity is brisk, and highlights flavors of cherries, red currants, pomegranates, cola, Chinese five-spice and Proven?al herbs. Might develop for a few years, although it's hard to predict, since it's a new brand.",89,45,California
32880,US,"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.",92,30,Washington
32890,US,"Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, with explosive blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, gingerbread, cola and smoky oak flavors. The structure is very fine, with rich, ripely smooth tannins and good acidity. Delicious now, and should remain so for several years.",92,80,California
32900,US,"Black as night in the glass and noticeably viscous, this shows brooding aromas of heavy char, black tobacco, cassis, bloody meat and balsamic vinegar. The palate isn't so heavy, though. Good acidity and tannins glide across the tongue while offering flavors of pencil lead, black cherry extract and black pepper.",91,45,California
32910,France,"A light, delicate wine, with spice and pear flavors, some quince, green plums. To balance this, there is a streak of minerality, which cuts through the fruits.",89,,Burgundy
32920,US,"A really great mountain Zinfandel that shows luscious power and fruit at a fair price. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, oranges, cloves and white pepper flood the palate and are just wonderful to experience. At this price, buy this Zin by the case.",88,13,California
32930,US,"This savory Zin screams its varietal identity with a blast of pepper, nutmeg and clove that accompanies ripe blackberries, wild cherries, mulberries and smoky oak. The wine feels very soft and lightly elegant in the mouth, but fully dry. Perfect for restaurant wine lists.",88,13,California
32940,Australia,"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts aromas and flavors of smoke and grilled pineapple. It may be a little on the simple side, but it's well done, combining ample varietal character with an appetizing bit of oak.",87,16,South Australia
32950,Italy,"Rubiolo offers a unique palette of aromas, including ripe berry, spice, blackberry preserves and milk chocolate. Chewy and dense in the mouth, it would pair with lamb shanks or pork chops marinated in olive oil and rosemary.",87,,Tuscany
32960,US,"Light in body, with savory acidity, this Pinot offers plush flavors of raspberry tart, red cherry pie filling, root beer, mocha and cinnamon spice. It's more elegant than complex. Drink now.",87,36,California
32970,US,"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture.",90,55,California
32980,US,"This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas. The palate kicks off with a touch of mint, then offers thick blueberry, coffee syrup and soy flavors. The structure is still quite sticky, and will open with time.",90,55,California
32990,France,"Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now.",90,15,Bordeaux

33030,US,"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears.",87,13,California
33040,US,"Grown in the famous Monte Rosso Vineyard, this rosé has the complex interest of a red wine, but it's a blush and is properly light-bodied and silky. It's dry and crisp, and shows bitter cherryskin, white tobacco and spice flavors.",87,22,California
33050,Chile,"Earthy plum and cherry aromas are cool and lightly herbal. This feels juicy and tight, but clean. Flavors of herbal plum are a touch roasted, while this everyday Cab finishes spicy and the slightest bit green.",87,11,Rapel Valley
33060,Portugal,"From two parcels, this open lagar fermented wine is structured and still tannic. It shows the firm character of the Jaen grape with no oak aging. Berry fruits will come through further as the wine develops. Drink from 2018.",87,,D?o
33070,Portugal,"With layers of ripe tannins and generous red fruits, this is an attractive, fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has a smoky, meaty character that contrasts with the fine fruits. Drink now.",87,15,Tejo

33090,US,"Coming from the state's premier Riesling vineyard, this wine opens with lightly styled aromas of slate, apricot and peach. It drinks a hair off dry, with honeyed stone-fruit flavors.",88,18,Washington
33100,US,"Red apple, pink rose petals and orange-laced bubblegum combine for a light and refreshing nose on this delicate, Pinot Noir-based rosé. There is good energy and verve to the sip, which is nearly effervescent at first, then delivers slightly sour watermelon, strawberry and red-plum flavors.",88,25,California
33110,Argentina,"Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.",84,10,Mendoza Province
33120,US,"Time has not tamed this in-your-face, oaky, high-octane Syrah, which on the label says it's also known as “rasta red.??The wine is very tannic, smelling of earth and tar and sticky caramel and could use a touch more fruitiness to give it a lift. Do not attempt to drink without a sauce-slathered side of beef.",84,30,California
33130,US,"The wine is noted as off dry on the back label, but you won't taste any sweetness whatsoever. It's tart, green, almost sour, with green apple fruit that hints at cardboard in the finish.",85,20,Oregon
33140,Italy,"This opens with aromas of scorched earth, cooked black-skinned fruit and a funky whiff of barnyard. The aromas carry over to the palate along with notes of prune, overripe black fruit and green sensations that recall powdered sage. It's on the rustic side, while raspy tannins lend it an astringent finish.",85,60,Tuscany
33150,Chile,"Earthy, loamy and raisiny on the nose, this blend of Cabernet and Syrah has an almost lazy mouthfeel braced by a shot of acidity. Earthy raspberry and blackberry flavors finish direct, with herbal notes. This is the epitome of a competent yet average wine.",85,12,Maule Valley
33160,France,"This is a classic Bordeaux-style white wine with its cool herbal character and light perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend. The wine has no oak aging, just ripe fruit that has citrus, pineapple and green fruit flavors. Drink now.",87,10,Southwest France

33180,US,"Fashion designer/vintner Richard Hirsh is aiming for the mass market with this approachable if slightly sweet blend.

It's soft on the palate, with candied apple, brown sugar and lemongrass flavors.",87,32,California
33190,US,"Different vintages favor different sites, and this Goosepen Block offering, though perfectly made, is not quite as dense the other vintage offerings from Sokol Blosser. A wash of milk chocolate surrounds raspberry and cherry fruit. Smooth and supple, with a streak of cola and red licorice, it fades gently into a finish tinged with flavors of clay.",90,80,Oregon
33200,Germany,"Hints of umami richness lend savoriness to primary red-cherry and cranberry flavors on this nuanced wine. Supple like silk yet refreshingly mineral, it finishes crisp and clean with lingering wet-granite notes.",90,103,Baden

33220,US,Carbonic maceration is the fermentation technique employed in this wine. It brings out vibrant Bing-cherry flavors and with a hint of bread dough. There are interesting highlights of cured meats also. This is a good choice for drinking with roasted birds.,86,22,Oregon
33230,Argentina,"Leather and earthy notes circle around core berry scents. This is medium bodied, with expansive but nonspecific berry and plum flavors. A wide, chunky finish is good but doesn't go beyond the basics.",85,10,Mendoza Province
33240,Germany,"Dancing on the nose and palate, this Pinot Noir rosé fills the glass with whiffs of cherry blossoms and sugar cookies. Tart red-cherry and berry flavors are delicate and spry on the palate, lingering nervously in a luscious mousse of soft, rolling bubbles. Finishes elegantly with a bristle of stony minerals.",92,35,Rheingau
33250,US,"Gap's Crown remains a magical site for Pinot producers and Fulcrum does justice to it, providing a subtle entry of soft oak on the nose before letting it open further into dark, brambly berry and earth. The backbone is strong and structured, and the finish is long and soft, with an ideal seasoning of exotic Mediterranean spice and herb that linger fully and invite one in for more.",92,60,California
33260,Italy,"The nose is still closed on this bracing red but it eventually reveals whiffs of black plum, licorice and leather. The dense, extracted palate offers blackberry, Marasca cherry, clove, espresso, licorice and a blast of black pepper. It's still young, with brooding tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2017??025. T. Edward Wines, J&J Importers.",92,40,Veneto
33270,France,"There is no question of the grape in this 100% Négrette wine. It shouts the violet perfumes and firm young tannins with a juicy black fruit layer. The wine is more fruit than tannin, with a fresh red fruit aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2016.",87,15,Southwest France
33280,Italy,"New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.",87,37,Tuscany

33300,Austria,"Intensely crisp wine, very fresh, with red currant fruit flavors, a touch of caramel, but deliciously refreshing. Great as a mouthwatering apéritif. Screwcap.",85,14,Burgenland
33310,Australia,"Shows plenty of red fruit character, starting with cherry but encompassing strawberry as well. It's plump and round in the mouth, but refreshingly modest in alcohol (13.1%), finishing clean. The winery says it's made from Fragola, which turns out to be an American variety known as Isabella. Imported by Margaret River Wines.",85,18,Western Australia
33320,Spain,"Our bet is that a granular, reduced, raisiny wine like this will not have broad appeal. Yet if you are interested in trying a blend of Samsó, Garnacha and Syrah it has some core qualities, namely old-school raisin and plum flavors backed by core tannins. A country-style wine if there ever was one.",84,12,Catalonia
33330,US,"Too overtly sweet. Some wines like this are super-fruity in cherries and raspberries but finish dry. This one doesn't, despite a scour of acidity. Feels unbalanced. Drink now.",84,38,California
33340,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",84,19,Galicia
33350,US,"Petal pink in the glass, this wine was specifically grown to be a rosé by winemaker David Galzignato. The nose is pretty with bubble gum, strawberry, raspberry and a bit of lime peel, and the palate offers flavors of ruby-red grapefruit and lemon juice, with bright acidity throughout.",88,25,California
33360,US,"Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors. Tannins are soft and there's a suggestion of saddle leather. It offers plenty of enjoyment for a Pinot at this price.",87,16,Oregon
33370,Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of charred earth, game and a funky whiff of barnyard. The evolved palate offers dried black cherries, prune, coffee, clove, oak and licorice alongside fleeting but astringent tannins.",87,85,Tuscany
33380,Argentina,"Light prune aromas signify a wine on the cusp. Astringent and rubbery in the mouth, this is raw in feel and tastes raisiny and like briary raspberry.",81,19,Mendoza Province
33390,US,"Those who think they prefer anything but Chardonnay may be convinced otherwise with this wine. It is so powerfully evocative in crisply rendered Meyer lemon and tangerine notes, with aromas of fresh white flowers teasing provocatively on the nose. Seamless and seductively bright in acidity, it glides down the palate, hinting at a richness that never becomes overdone.",96,65,California
33400,US,"This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out.",95,78,California
33410,US,"A 100% varietal wine from grapes sourced in Coombsville, this offers cranberry, currant and clove in equal measure. This tiny-production project features tight-grained tannin and a dusty texture built around moderate acidity and body.",88,75,California
33420,US,Pleasant whiffs of smoked nut and blossom accent fresh apple and pear in this squarely balanced dry white. Fresh acidity on the midpalate lends zip to a lingering but refreshing finish. Drink now through 2020.,88,15,New York
33430,France,"The estate is located to the north west of the village of Fleurie, further into the hills. The wine is structured and tannic with layers of red berries and tight acidity. It will need to soften for a few months, so drink from late 2017.",88,224,Beaujolais
33440,US,"With the fruit coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of coffee, cocoa, smoke, vanilla and purple fruit. The flavors are elegant in style, with nubby tannins providing the frame.",88,23,Washington
33450,US,"Deep golden-yellow in the glass, this wine offers honeyed, candied aromas of mango, crystallized vanilla and golden raisin. It's thick and unctuous on the palate, with more honey, spun sugar, honeysuckle and fruit-nectar flavors that are delicious, but would be aided by a boost of acidity.",88,,California
33460,France,"This negociant wine is soft, ripe and smoothly textured. It has a fine balance between acidity and the rich red cherry fruit. With its edge of tannins, it has a good structure that gives it shape. Drinkable now.",88,15,Beaujolais
33470,Italy,"Red berry, baking spice and scorched earth aromas waft from the glass of this straightforward red. The easygoing palate offers red berry, cinnamon and a gamey note alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so drink now.",87,,Tuscany
33480,US,"This fresh, appealing wine is lightly spritzy, with flavors of pear and melon that show persistence.",87,12,Washington
33490,US,"Brawny in blackberry, blueberry and black pepper, with a shake of cinnamon, this is a soft, complex wine with leathery undertones. From steep, volcanic-soiled vines, it's appropriately tannic without being overbearing.",87,55,California
33500,US,"Black and green olive tapenade and ripe plum come together around a soft, juicy yet ultimately tannic expression of the variety, given 14% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon as worthy complements.",86,35,California
33510,Spain,"This is funky up front, with aromas of Russian dressing and briny citrus. The mouthfeel is chunky and foamy, while the flavor profile runs heavy and sweet, with candied citrus and molasses notes. A weighty finish tastes of brown sugar.",86,16,Catalonia
33520,US,"Aromatic and forward, this is scented and flavored with macerated red plums and cherries. It remains tough and chewy, showing buttery lactic flavors that have not entirely integrated, with a bitter edge to the finish. More bottle age may help smooth it out.",86,32,Oregon
33530,New Zealand,"This is a fairly big, muscular Pinot Noir, with beefy black-cherry fruit and oaky overtones of brown sugar. Give it a year or more to smooth out, because the long, intense finish filled with berry fruit shows tremendous promise. Drink 2013??020.",92,50,Central Otago
33540,France,"Powerful, concentrated Chablis. It is rich, with ripe apricot and nectarine fruit, laced with Seville orange acidity. With a touch of toast, a well-integrated structure, this is a wine for medium-term aging.",92,80,Burgundy
33550,US,"This wine is another rewarding Cabernet from a winery with a great track record over the years. Blended with some Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's dry and ultrasmooth, and while the tannins are thick, they're sweet and ripe. The blackberry, cherry, blueberry and cassis flavors have a rich, fleshy opulence. Drink now??015.",92,48,California
33560,Italy,"Fragrant spring flower, citrus blossom and orchard fruit aromas leap from the glass. The slightly off-dry tangy palate presents ripe green apple, white peach and a juicy note of candied lemon drop offset by crisp acidity and a lively perlage.",88,22,Veneto
33570,South Africa,"This is a plush and fully fruited wine that's super easy to like, with attractive aromas and flavors of blackberry compote, raspberry sauce and ripe boysenberry that are all hit with seductive notes of sweet spice and vanilla bean. There's ample tannic structure at the core, framing the dense, decadent mouthfeel and lending some lingering grip to the close.",88,15,Coastal Region
33580,US,"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front.",88,22,Washington
33590,Israel,"The nose is strong on this wine, with intense notes of kirsch, brandied raisins and fruit cake spice. Medium weight with fine-grain tannins and more sweet red fruit preserve flavors developing in the mouth. The finish oozes with a vanilla crème flavor. Rich and flavorful but definitely falls on the sweeter side.",88,50,Galilee

33630,Italy,"Bright and refreshing, this sparkler opens with aromas of small red berry and a whiff of cake spice. Made entirely with Pinot Nero, the vibrant palate offers strawberry, raspberry and a cinnamon note alongside crisp acidity.",89,26,Piedmont
33640,Greece,"Fresh lemon, sea salt and grapefruit aromas lead this buoyant pour from Crete. On the palate, appealing flavors of ripe lemon, tropical fruit and spice give it weight enough to pair with heartier dishes. That said, it finishes clean with a peppery finish.",89,16,Crete
33650,Austria,"The slightest touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose. Underneath, the crisp, slender palate is dominated by appetizing notes of ripe lemon. A tiny bit of spritz makes the slender body seem almost weightless, but all that lovely lemon fruit fills mouth and nose. The finish is featherlight and refreshing.",89,19,Südsteiermark
33660,France,"With its relatively high alcohol, it is logical that this should be a rich wine. It has juicy blackberry fruits cut with acidity while having weight and density. It is almost pure Merlot which gives the wine its fruit and concentration. Drink from 2019.",90,35,Bordeaux
33670,Italy,"Made of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 10% Sangiovese, this offers black currant scents laced with cake spice. The round, juicy palate delivers blackberry jam, pipe tobacco and clove flavors as well as chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2021.",90,42,Tuscany

33710,US,"Tastes way too oaky, with a plaster of sweet vanilla and caramelized charcoal. The underlying pineapple fruit just isn't strong enough to support all that wood.",82,19,California
33720,Australia,"Excessively volatile, with some briary, berry-like fruit that's overwhelmed by slightly pickle-y notes. It's medium in body, but thins out on the finish.",81,40,Victoria
33730,Chile,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card.",86,13,Curicó and Leyda Valleys

33750,Spain,"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made.",86,17,Catalonia
33760,France,"This wine, while rich, has all the minerality and crisp texture associated with the appellation. Wood aging adds spice. It needs some aging, not much, and will be ready to drink from 2019.",90,86,Burgundy
33770,US,"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish.",90,23,Washington
33780,US,"Light and delicate on the nose, this single-vineyard Chardonnay shows white peach, honeysuckle and browned butter on the nose. There is good tension to the sip, but also riper flavors of apple cider, pan-seared pear and lemon preserves.",90,60,California
33790,US,"This tremendous red wine is robustly aromatic, layering its black currant, dark cherry and chocolate scents with dusty sage and cedar. Luxuriously textured and smooth, it finishes focused and direct, with a lift of welcome acidity and complexity.",94,95,California
33800,France,"A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Ch?teau Giscours in Margaux. It is packed with black fruits, spice and dense tannins that are melding together so well. Licorice and wood aging give the wine an extra complex dimension. Drink this from 2019.",93,36,Provence
33810,Spain,A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power. Blackberry and earthy notes finish stout and compact: this doesn't vary or waver on the back end. Best from 2019??026.,93,44,Northern Spain

33840,Italy,"A true labor of love, this fabulous Vin Santo opens with beautiful intensity and infinite aromas of roasted chestnut, maple syrup, caramel, butterscotch and candied orange. It's divine in the mouth, with thick, luscious layers of glycerine and succulent sweetness. This is what Italians call a meditation wine that can easily be consumed alone after dinner.",97,,Tuscany

33910,Israel,"Aromas of apricot and cantaloupe pave the way for flavors of apricot, apple and smoked meat with a touch of river rocks.

33920,France,"A light, mineral-textured wine, this is bone-dry while also packed with fruit. As its name suggests, it's a happy wine while having just a bit more of intensity. The aftertaste brings out the fruitiness.",86,18,Provence

33970,Italy,"A pure expression of Refosco, this runs heavy on prune, plum and dark berry aromas. Its bold aromatic intensity is backed by touches of acidity and smooth tannins. Try it with savory meats, like lamb.",88,,Veneto
33980,France,"Accurate varietal character abounds in this value red. There’s dark berry and a slight herbaceousness, but not in an off-putting way. Light in style but it possesses nice mouthfeel with smooth cassis fruit and a decent finish.",85,7,Languedoc-Roussillon
33990,US,"Very lively and jumpy, with bright cherry fruit supported by high-voltage acidity. It hits the high notes, but lacks the bass below, and therefore is ultimately a bit out of balance. Very much a cherry-fruit dominated, one-dimensional wine",84,12,Oregon
34000,Italy,"Two years of aging in French oak help shape the overall quality of this beautiful wine. It opens with a luminous garnet color and segues to aromas of spice, anise seed, mineral and black fruit. This is a penetrating interpretation of Nebbiolo with firm tannins and a powerful finish.",91,120,Piedmont
34010,France,"A bouquet of summer desserts—strawberry soup, apricot pie and lemon meringue pie—pull you into the glass. Although not quite as nuanced, the palate delivers enticing apricot and wet stone notes. The unctuous palate and noticeable residual sugar will partner well with fish in an Asian-fusion preparation.",91,22,Alsace
34020,Italy,"Barolo San Lorenzo has very nice intensity—it's there, but not in your face. The wine is already starting to show some interesting mineral components that are backed by black fruit, licorice and truffle. Its intensity builds in the glass and although it starts slow, it picks up loads of speed in the mouth. Drink after 2015.",91,70,Piedmont
34030,Italy,"Aromas of cassis, spicy black plum and juicy blackberry follow through to the palate, balanced by ripe, round tannins. A licorice note signals the finish.",87,25,Central Italy

34050,US,"Sourced from the winery's estate vineyard, this bottling presents a compelling depth of earthiness, a stony, rocky sense that gives it a savory edge. Tobacco and tea surround ample plum and blueberry. The wine is approachable and soft, with tiny percentages of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.",88,32,California
34060,Italy,"Ripe blackberry, grilled herb, toast and ground pepper aromas lead the nose of this blend of Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean and bitter sage alongside grippy tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.",88,29,Tuscany
34070,Italy,"Aromas of black plum and fragrant blue flowers waft out of the glass. On the bright, easygoing palate, notes of mint and white pepper add interest to the black cherry core. Fresh acidity and supple tannins back up the juicy flavors.",88,25,Tuscany
34080,US,"A rugged, fierce wine, brusque in tannins, that needs big, rich meats and oils to balance it out. Short ribs and similar fare will play well against the blackberry and raisin flavors of this high-alcohol Zin.",85,29,California
34090,US,"Very sweet-smelling, like putting your nose in a bowl of sugar, followed by aromas of ripe pineapple juice, this smooth Sauvignon Blanc from the Michael David folks is sweet through and through.",84,14,California
34100,US,"This is a boldly expressive testament to the vineyard site from which it comes. A concentrated and lushly textured wine, it exudes lime and a hit of tropical papaya buoyed as it goes by bristling acidity and a hint of wild vanilla. Indicative of a ripe, warm vintage, it remains balanced and deliciously exuberant from start to finish.",93,45,California
34110,US,"The fruit is sourced from the Thistle and Hyland estate vineyards. It's an intense, concentrated wine, with a complex mix of mineral, lime, apple and light tropical fruit. It's textural, creamy and impressively long.",93,48,Oregon
34120,Australia,"This full-bodied yet silky Shiraz delivers tremendous elegance for its size. It's complex as well, boasting aromas that range from vanilla and brown sugar through to marinated beef and raspberry compote. The richly-textured finish lingers for minutes. Drink now??025.",93,100,South Australia
34130,US,"This young wine brims with fresh acidity and primary cherry, blackberry and cola flavors. The complexity is considerable and so is the elegance. It feels graceful and silky in the mouth, despite the power of the fruit. Should hit its peak in two or three years.",90,25,California
34140,Italy,"This is a lovely Sauvignon that opens with huge aromatic intensity and flavors of stone fruit, chopped basil and citrus. Expressive and bright, it's true to the semi-aromatic variety. Screwcap.",90,30,Northeastern Italy
34150,Argentina,"Respectable red fruit aromas carry a slight pickled sharpness and the scent of a matchstick, while the palate is lactic and creamy, with strawberry, raspberry, plum and herbal notes. Plump and reasonably well balanced, with an herbal finish.",84,10,Mendoza Province
34160,Australia,"This Riesling starts out strong, with a likable tangle of apricots, peaches and apples on the nose. The palate is a bit watery, though it offers up some nice flavors of lime rind and pomelo. Short finish. Drink soon, preferably with cold roast pork.",84,16,Tasmania
34170,US,"Softly tannic and ripe. Offers flamboyant blackberry, raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, generously spiced, with a soft, sweet finish. A good everyday, multi-purpose Zin.",84,20,California
34180,Chile,"This spunky rosé relies mostly on Itata Cinsault, but also Colchagua fruit. The nose is alert but simple, with tangerine and peach-pit aromas. This feels round yet lively, while briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors finish salty and a bit sulfuric.",85,21,Chile

34200,Chile,"Light simple citrus aromas fall halfway between punchy and vacuous. This feels wet but basic, while briny flavors of pickled cucumber and scallion blend with citrus notes. A fair finish is fresh and light.",85,11,Curicó Valley
34210,US,"This small-production, estate-grown wine needs more time in bottle to lose some of the beery yeastiness it currently shows. Along with those strong flavors are lighter threads of yellow apple and grapefruit rind.",86,16,Oregon
34220,Portugal,"This blend of Syrah, Castel?o and Aragonez has the typical cool feel of a wine from coastal Lisboa. It offers firm tannins, stalky black currant fruits and bright acidity, all packaged in a smooth texture with a soft, juicy aftertaste.",86,13,Lisboa
34230,Italy,"Fresh and clean with a personality largely driven by citrus, stone fruit and toasted bread or yeast, this Italian sparkling wine shows background tones of talc powder and almond skin. There's a touch of sour fruit on the close.",88,,Veneto
34240,Portugal,"Young Moscatel de Setúbal brings out fruitiness and freshness as much as richness. So with this wine, you find a lemon and honey character, attractive acidity and a light texture. Delicious to drink now.",88,20,Moscatel de Setúbal
34250,Italy,Sweet tones of peach and nectarine are backed by honey and yellow rose. The sweetness in this dry expression from the Cartizze cru is very evident and the wine does a nice job of showing creamy effervescence to render more volume and richness on the finish.,88,30,Veneto
34260,Australia,"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023??035.",94,65,South Australia
34270,US,"One of the first producers to work with Bucher Vineyard fruit, this shows familiarity and comfort in its ability to coax black cherry, pomegranate and allspice flavors, wrapping them in a voluptuous mouthfeel. Full-bodied and lushly layered, it's lengthy with a touch of smoke.",94,50,California
34280,France,"Intense citrus is overlaid by the ripe pineapple and tropical fruit. This delicious complex wine, with its tangy acidity, tightly coiled texture and touches of wood aging, is packed with great fruit. Drink from 2021.",94,50,Bordeaux
34290,Chile,"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.",86,25,Colchagua Valley
34300,Chile,"Dusty apple and pear aromas are likable. This feels soft, leesy and creamy as young Chardonnay goes, with stalky, slightly mealy flavors of corn and apple. On the finish, things taste salty and briny.",85,14,Leyda Valley
34310,Italy,"Here's a bright and easy-drinking wine made from Trebbiano, Passerina and Pecorino grapes. It has sensations of acacia flower, lemon and peach alongside vibrant acidity.",85,18,Central Italy

34330,France,"This is a refreshingly crisp and fruity wine. It has the lightest of tannins to shape the fresh red-fruit flavors. The wine comes from a 74-acre estate, owned by the same family for 10 generations.",84,13,Beaujolais
34340,Spain,"Candied strawberry and grassy aromas unfold on the nose. On the palate, this blend of Monastrell and Pinot Noir feels heavy. A mix of candied red-fruit flavors and weedy notes finish short.",84,10,Catalonia
34350,France,"92-94. Barrel sample. A smooth, mellifluous wine, with its intensity masked by tight acidity. It shows the weight of the vintage, and the power of the botrytis that's interspersed with flavors of orange zest and lime. It should age magnificently.",93,,Bordeaux
34360,US,"Finished off-dry, this tasty Riesling mixes a core of peach and apricot fruit with interesting streaks of candied pineapple. The acids keep it brisk and refreshing.",88,13,Washington
34370,Italy,"This elegant blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Canaiolo displays fragrant floral aromas of red roses, violets and dried lavender. There's fruit, too, but it takes the shape of cassis and dried berries. The wine finishes with polished tannins and a smoky touch of white mushrooms or leather.",88,50,Tuscany
34380,Portugal,"Richly ripe wine, dominated by sweet yellow fruit, although with a fine line of acidity that brings a greener element. Wood spice comes through on the finish of this full-bodied wine.",88,15,Douro
34390,France,"Superripe fruit gives the wine weight and richness, toast and peach and pineapple fruits. Old vines give the concentration and opulent fruit. Worth aging 2?? years.",92,49,Burgundy
34400,US,"Shows the dry tannins and astringency of youthful Hanzell, but these Pinot Noirs are famously capable of extended aging. Tastes almost rustic now, with a deep core of cherries and cola. The oak is unintegrated, further accentuating the wine's immaturity. Needs time. Better after 2013, and should develop for an additional decade.",91,95,California
34410,Italy,"Decima Aurea is a refined and elegant expression of Merlot with deep and long aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry pie, Indian spice, clove and old spice. The wine shows the sophistication of age, but also promises years of cellar aging.",91,52,Veneto
34420,Argentina,"Earthy, leathery, stewed aromas are more savory than fruity. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is full, flush and resiny. Savory blueberry, Middle Eastern spice notes and oaky flavors reside in front of a roasted finish with grab and grip.",89,37,Mendoza Province
34430,Argentina,"Floral berry and plum aromas are direct and pure, emphasizing fruit over oak. A punchy palate follows the nose, while bright plum and berry flavors complete the package. This captures the essence of Malbec while not going overboard.",89,19,Mendoza Province
34440,Italy,"This intensely fragrant wine opens with violet, woodland berry and star anise aromas. The racy palate offers sour cherry, cranberry and ground clove flavors framed by taut tannins and brisk acidity, feeling just underripe.",89,45,Piedmont
34450,Chile,"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",87,12,Casablanca-Curicó Valley

34480,US,"Grapefruit, orange and cherry mélange nicely together on the palate of this tantalizingly zesty wine, the acidity front and forward. Fresh and refreshing, the tang mellows on the finish, providing medium body and weight.",88,20,California
34490,Italy,"Delicate scents of white flower and apricot lead the nose. The bright, round palate doles out ripe peach, pear and a hint of hazelnut that lead to a fresh finish.",88,18,Piedmont
34500,Chile,"Average peach and apple aromas are as good as it gets. The palate is wet, heavy, charmless and cidery, with aggressive apple and citrus flavors. And oak wouldn't likely help it.",80,7,Colchagua Valley
34510,US,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",95,50,California
34520,US,Too much tobacco on this wine that comes off as slightly overripe and sweet.,83,28,California
34530,US,"Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit.",83,25,Washington
34540,US,"The perfect California cool-climate Chardonnay. It's balanced and elegant, yet opulent, with beautiful acidity giving brightness to the ripe tangerine, pineapple, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème br?lée flavors.",92,30,California
34550,US,"Outstanding, with a honeyed note that suggests a hint of botrytis. A lovely blending of complex fruits, perfectly set against the acids and residual sugar just over one percent. This resonates beautifully.",92,18,Oregon
34560,France,"A wine that combines richness with a great structure. It is ripe, smoky, the red fruits rich and concentrated. A wine that is packed with juicy fruit and also with a good aging potential.",92,,Beaujolais
34570,Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",89,50,Spanish Islands
34580,Australia,"Toasty and citrusy, this is a prototypical méthode Champenoise sparkler, blending Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier from the cool island of Tasmania, off Australia's southern coast. It's medium in weight, with a crisp lemony finish that invites a second sip.",89,20,Tasmania
34590,US,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",90,75,Washington
34600,US,"This unusual rosé is a blend of both white and red grapes fermented together in oak barrels, but there's a nary a hint of toast or vanilla to suggest time in oak. It's an exceptionally well-integrated wine with fine finessed berry and watermelon flavors along with delicate hints of spice and cherry blossom. Zesty acidity and a fresh saline finish lend to its refreshing appeal.",90,30,New York
34610,Austria,"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing.",90,16,Nieder?sterreich
34620,Italy,"Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb. The linear palate is loaded with finesse and character, delivering creamy green apple, tangerine, mineral, white peach and mint. It's well balanced with bright acidity.",91,20,Northeastern Italy
34630,Australia,"Like an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2?? days, think 2?? years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time.",91,22,Western Australia
34640,US,"This project led by founder Jocko Douglas makes small batches of compelling wine. This Pinot Noir offers aromas of blackberry-laced tea, mocha and spearmint. The palate shows juicy, plump raspberries and blackberries bolstered by clove, allspice and espresso elements.",91,48,California
34650,US,"A bouquet of spicy black pepper intoxicates on the opening of this wine, followed by captivating waves of savory blackberry, leather and dust. The grapes are sourced from one of the producer's coolest sites, With well-integrated, unobtrusive oak, the wine is soft and delicious now, offering plenty of meaty undertones, but will intrigue further over time, through 2022.",94,65,California
34660,Germany,"Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed sp?tlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist.",93,33,Mosel

34700,Italy,"Underbrush, mature dark-skinned fruit, aromatic herb, menthol and baking spice aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The bold palate delivers mature black cherry, fig, chopped mint, pipe tobacco and clove set against a firm backbone of velvety tannins. Fresh acidity lifts the finish. Despite its robust structure, it's also surprisingly easy to drink—rare for Amarone.",92,60,Veneto
34710,Italy,Bright nuances of black cherry and prune are backed by softly toasted aromas of nut and spice. The one year of oak aging has helped to further soften the wine's velvety texture.,88,17,Sicily & Sardinia
34720,US,"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?",88,28,Oregon
34730,Italy,"Cerasuolo di Vittoria is one of the most exciting red wines to emerge from southern Italy in recent years. This is made with organic fruit, and it shows bright tones of raspberry and cassis, with some tones of toasted almond and light spice at the back.",88,16,Sicily & Sardinia
34740,Austria,"Soft and inviting ripeness of yellow plums leads to a spicy, peppery and wonderfully focused citrus center. This is a wine you want to savor, easing out every last notion of the layered spice.

34790,US,"This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs.",85,59,California
34800,Spain,"Ripe, minty and exuberant on the front end, this has a hint of animal in addition to a note of blueberry. Saturated and simple, this has a ripe red-berry flavor that comes across as red licorice. Fruity and fun.",85,10,Central Spain

34850,South Africa,"Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. This is too young to fully appreciate now, though it certainly starts to make an impression with tight aromas and flavors of blackberry, cassis, leather, licorice and cigar box. The gripping tannins provide a firm structure and dry finish, though ripe black-fruit flavors of black plum and cherry help to flesh out the medium-weight palate. Lingering notes of pepper, wood spice and anise grace the long finish. Drink 2019??025.",92,,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch
34860,South Africa,"Winemaker: Sebastian Beaumont. Initial aromas of barely ripe honeydew, green plum and lime pith are assertively laced with hints of fynbos and salinity on the nose. The palate is fresh and zingy, with green plum, apple and citrus fruit flavors that persist through the finish. A nice evolution unfolds on the close, transitioning from lively green fruits to citrus peel and finally ending on a subtle oaky-spice accent. It's young and nervy now, but should show more nuance and elegance with time; enjoy the ride through 2021.",91,,Bot River
34870,South Africa,"Winemaker: Gary Jordan. This is rich and ripe from the start, with intense aromas of cassis, black plum and berry that mingle with notes of charred meat, bacon and cigar box.

It's approachable now, but should age well through 2023.",90,,Stellenbosch
34880,Austria,"Terrassen wines are blends from vineyards across the lower slopes of the Wachau hills: the easy-drinking side of the region. This fresh, floral, crisply acidic Riesling exhibits the style well, with its tight texture over fragrant green fruits. There's delicious acidity to finish. Screwcap.",88,22,Wachau
34890,Chile,"Warm aromas of menthol, chocolate and black fruit are the opening act, which is followed by flashy flavors of grape bubble gum, blackberry and raspberry.

34930,US,"Malbec (46%) makes up most of this blend followed by 23% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and finished with Cabernet Franc.

Coffee flavors linger on the finish.",91,22,Washington
34940,US,"Muted aromatically at first, pushing to impart rose, sage and violet, this red offers an edginess of tobacco leaf and peppery meat. Structured acidity provides appreciated support and a contrast to medium-sized tannin.",91,65,California
34950,Portugal,"Dominated by Syrah, this wine is dark and dense. It is perfumed with solid tannins and the potential of juicy red fruits. Grown in the Pamela area of the Setúbal peninsula, south of Lisbon, the wine is both warm and densely concentrated. Drink from 2018.",91,16,Península de Setúbal
34960,US,"If only this blend of seven popular varieties were drier, it would score higher. It's crisp in acidity and complex in orange, peach, pear, honeysuckle, vanilla and mineral flavors. But the sugary finish puts it into the fruit juice category.",83,15,California
34970,US,"An awkward wine. Smells a little vegetal, and tastes weirdly sweet in raspberry and cherry syrup, with a cloying finish. Ready now.",82,48,California
34980,France,"Pale in color, this ripe wine is beautifully balanced. It does have rich fruit, raspberries and wild strawberries. It also has a fine texture with plenty of acidity as well as a touch of pepper. The wine could age a further few months, so drink at the end of 2017.",92,52,Provence
34990,Italy,"This elegantly structured wine is a wonderful expression of Sauvignon's serious side, offering delicate yellow stone fruit, wildflower and toasted nut scents.

35010,Italy,"There's a warm, yeasty quality to this bright sparkling blend (with Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) from northern Italy. It is redolent of apricot, toasted almond, freshly baked bread and dried roses. In the mouth, it shows a drying feel and piquant, fresh bubbling.",92,80,Lombardy
35020,US,"Showing an enormous blast of cherries and raspberries, this Pinot is saved from being a fruit bomb by earthy, mushroomy complexities and a hit of acidity that makes the mouth water. It's way too young now, and should easily take 5?? years in the cellar to come around.",92,80,California
35030,US,"Very fine, showing the class of this vineyard, at a great price. Although the wine is thoroughly dry, it's vast in pineapple and lime fruit, with a minerally tang from the terroir and rich, sweet buttered toast and vanilla notes from oak barrel aging. The minerality reprises throughout, giving the wine a steely authority.",92,28,California
35040,Greece,"Oak treatment adds a caramel spice to the crisp, cirtic flavors of Roditis. The nose, sweeter and slightly headier than the un-treated version, leads into a pretty, rounded fruit profile that marries the oaky spice and lemon character well. More dimension and less lift than the average Greek white.",86,27,Beotia
35050,Argentina,"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir.",86,9,Other

35070,Spain,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",83,8,Northern Spain
35080,Portugal,"A smooth and rich wine that is already delicious. It has ripe berry fruits, soft tannins and a full, juicy feel. A streak of acidity cuts through this generous wine. Drink now.",87,12,Tejo

35130,US,"Although the challenging vintage resulted in just a half-ton per acre of Chardonnay in this dry appellation (a third of its normal yield), this wine is fantastic. Flinty and smoky aromas lead to Gala apple, white peach and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate combines salt, grapefruit pith and seared apple flavors. A sharp line of acidity brings it all into balance.",91,42,California
35140,US,"This somewhat sweet Pinot tastes like a liquid version of raspberry jam, figs, vanilla cookies and buttered toast. Fine acidity gives it needed balance. Drink now.",86,25,California

35170,Italy,"Made from Nebbiolo aged in large casks, this garnet-colored wine offers lovely fragrances of rose petal and woodland berry.

35200,US,"From an oceanview vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills comes this project led by David Yates of Jaffurs Winery.

It finishes smooth and clean after a long tang.",91,46,California
35210,US,"Featuring a unique and intriguingly fresh and floral nose, this shows bright strawberry, fresh-pressed hibiscus flowers, exotic vanilla-cinnamon notes and hints of slate and chaparral. The palate is just a hair less exciting, with raspberry, cranberry, white pepper, white sage and dried mint, all wrapped with tart acidity and tannins.",91,40,California
35220,US,"This elegant, dry bubbly has a light-gold color, aromas like peach skin and white cherries, and flavors that are crisp, fruity and vivid. It starts out reserved before opening up to riper, richer tones, partly due to 15% reserve wine in the blend. Not just for toasting, it will make a very good match with seafood.",91,27,California
35230,Chile,"Light and prickly in style, with citrus aromas along with tight cherry and plum scents. Runs lean in the mouth, with short, tart red fruit flavors in front of a crisp, sheer finish.",83,10,Central Valley
35240,US,"Crisp red plum and cherry flavors accented with ripe, brambly wood notes are pleasant, but coarse tannins combined with a slightly craggy acidity make this Long Island Cab Franc less than harmonious on the palate.",82,20,New York
35250,Italy,"This wine reflects the difficulty of the cool, wet 2014 vintage. It's lean and diluted, with medicinal sensations that recall adhesive bandage and mineral.",83,30,Northeastern Italy
35260,US,"A strong buttery, jammy aroma and flavors like cherry candy make an unusual profile and cover up most varietal flavors in the grapes.",82,11,California

35320,France,"This is a crisp, firmly structured blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache (within the Rh?ne, Signargues is best known for its Syrah). The asphalt, black olive and black cherry notes are all positive, but the structure dominates, making the wine seem a bit tough and ungenerous. Perhaps another year or two of aging will help?",85,18,Rh?ne Valley
35330,Italy,"Here's a southern Italian red with Barolo-like austerity: elegant notes of small berry fruit are seamlessly folded within layers of slate roof, ash, graphite, licorice and fine expressions rendered by volcanic soils and 18 months of oak aging. It really comes alive in the mouth, where the wine delivers power, concentration and a very long-lasting finish. This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",93,65,Southern Italy
35340,Australia,"Made in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth.

35360,US,"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018??025.",92,100,Oregon
35370,US,"This captivating wine, from vines dating back to the early 1970s, will reward your patience.

Once it does, it will delight with juicy citrus, ample acidity, and plenty of grip.",92,35,Oregon
35380,US,"This is the first Grenache from Nefarious, and it's a beauty. Sourced from the Upland vineyard in the tiny Snipes Mountain AVA, it is bursting with pure, sweet fruit flavors, tart and lip-smackingly juicy. A subtle minerality with a hint of wet cement gives it tannic authority, while the aging in once-filled French oak barrels adds a touch of baking spices.",92,30,Washington

It's brimming with notes of cedar, sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa powder that ride atop the baked cherry and raspberry fruit.

35520,US,Firesteed's value-oriented Pinot is a solid and reliable wine that varies little from vintage to vintage. Flavors of rhubarb and strawberry are set in place with a touch of vanilla wafer. Don't cellar this. It's ready to go.,87,17,Oregon

35590,Germany,"This is a prototypical Saar Riesling, with classic green apple and citrus flavors underscored by slate-driven minerality that lingers for a long time on the finish. Despite the sensation of plumpness, the wine is light on its feet. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",91,29,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
35600,Germany,"Made in a powerful, almost dry style with 12% alcohol, this is not a typical kabinett. The aromas boast admirably pure pear and pineapple scents, but the flavors show slaty, spicy complexity—this is much more than simply fruity. The texture is creamy and the lingering finish shows off more spice and stones. Might age, but it's so impressive now, why wait?",91,35,Rheingau
35610,Argentina,"Attractive aromas of fresh berry fruits are vital and announce a plump but punchy palate with toasty, blackened flavors of wild berries and lactic oak. A toasty finish stops just short of bitterness, while pouring on the power. Drink through 2022.",91,,Mendoza Province

35650,Argentina,"This bigraisiny-smelling Malbec opens with overt oak aromas and related hints of char and lemon peel. An expansive palate is high in acidity and drying. Raw oak flavors rest atop baked plum, blackberry and prune notes, while this tastes toasty and charred on a powerful finish that's driven by tartaric acidity.",88,32,Mendoza Province
35660,US,"About as pale in color as they come, this wine is not light on flavor. It has bright citrus and dried herb aromas and similarly assertive flavors, backed by crisp acidity. It should pair perfectly with seafood and is bold enough for grilled garlic prawns.",88,20,California

35720,US,"Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind. With patience, it unpeels layers of soft, floral aromas and quiet notions of raspberry and strawberry.",91,65,California
35730,France,"Now mature, this ripe wine has a creamy texture that is cut with the steely acidity of Chablis. Yellow fruits and a bright aftertaste keep this wine in the fruity stage. The aftertaste, though, has a more leafy character that shows its maturity. Drink now.",91,40,Burgundy

35770,Italy,"Terre di Giumara shows dark concentration and savory aromas of forest floor, barbecue sauce, blackberry and button mushroom. Bitter almond appears on the close and there's a touch of tight astringency as well.",86,14,Sicily & Sardinia
35780,US,"A new vineyard source for the producer, this was planted in 1910 to a mix of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Peloursin and Trousseau. The wine shows a zestiness to the palate and fruit, a mix of pomegranate, raspberry and plum, side-kicked by dusty mocha. Bright in acidity with a chalky finish, the wine can be enjoyed now with a decant or cellared through 2022.",90,43,California
35790,France,"With smoky tannins and tangy acidity, this wine is solid, dense and full of toasty wood. Over this structure, black currant notes are fragrant and attractive. Drink from 2018.",90,,Bordeaux
35800,Italy,"Underbrush, berry, blue flower and rose lead the nose. Still closed, the firm palate eventually reveals dry cherry, licorice and baking spice. A backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provides support. It closes on a menthol note.",89,80,Tuscany
35810,US,"This is a solid wine, full-bodied and dry, and while it's a little rustic on its own, barbecue will elevate it. Blended from the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, as well as 10% Syrah, its blackberry and cherry fruit is complexed with smoked meat and tamari, set off with crisp acidity. Drink now??015.",88,35,California
35820,France,"Created by Vigouroux as a hommage to Malbec in Cahors and Argentina, this has the structure of Cahors and the rich smoothness of Mendoza. Complex, powerful, full of ripe fruit, it's impressively juicy, textured and full of acidity at the end.",88,15,Southwest France
35830,US,"Coming from one of Washington's premier Riesling sites, it's redolent with peach, mineral and floral notes. It drinks almost completely dry with bright, crisp acids.",88,16,Washington
35840,France,"91-93 Full-bodied wine, with toast and a strong citrus and herbaceous character. The wine is open, soft, generous, finishing with a very spicy character.",92,,Bordeaux
35850,France,"91-93 New, polished wood and mint aromas, a wine that shows big wood tannins. The fruit has the right weight to come through all the wood, with acidity already an important factor.",92,,Bordeaux
35860,France,"91-93 A powerful wine, very ripe and rounded. Finely concentrated, with dark plum skins and opulent tannins.",92,,Bordeaux
35870,US,"Brims with briary blackberry fruit, spicy and ripe, enhanced with a layer of oak. It's a little jammy and hot, and also is quite tannic, but there's a firm nobility in there. Give it a good decant and enjoy.",87,45,California
35880,US,"Lots of tangy acidity in this Chard, and tannins too. It has a grainy, stubborn mouthfeel. Shows plenty of pineapple, orange, apricot and lime flavors, with sweet oak essence, but cant quite overcome that resistant tug. Drink now.",87,39,California
35890,US,"Some wines fall outside the tasting box, and this is one of those. Intense, rich and distinctive—it's not your father's Chardonnay. Spontaneous fermentation (through native yeast) contributes to the texture and density. Concentrated fruit suggests nectarines, Meyer lemon and candied oranges just on the edge of being overripe. Drink now through 2018.",91,30,Oregon
35900,US,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots.",91,65,Oregon
35910,US,"Dry and sappy, this potent effort is heavily influenced by botanical flavors, to the point of being almost grassy. Dry extract and lemon/lime acidity keep the riper fruit flavors in check, but with ample breathing time the wine fills in with highlights of fresh peaches.",91,24,Oregon
35920,US,"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry.",91,48,California
35930,France,"On the south side of the village of Chablis, the Vaillons vineyard is on the cool, left bank of the river Serein. It is fruity with a creamy texture and a line of steely acidity that often marks out the premier crus, giving this wine the chance to age. Drink from 2017.",91,40,Burgundy
35940,US,"This big mouthful of wine offers great value. Smelling like licorice and chocolate and tasting like superripe berries and black figs, this brute has full body, great concentration and richness of flavor, a thick but soothing texture, and a long, lingering finish.",91,16,California
35950,US,"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.",94,59,California
35960,US,"One of the best Cabernet-Syrah blends out there. The Cabernet dominates, with firm tannins and blackberry and currant flavors, but Syrah brings a meatiness, like teriaki beef. Terrifically interesting, this wine should develop over the next four years.",93,55,California
35970,Spain,"Pure and penetrating, with full berry aromas and power throughout. Tight and generous in the mouth, with nice acidity and structured tannins. Tastes toasty and black, with loads of berry, chocolate and spice flavors. Impressive and big; drink now through 2017.",93,50,Northern Spain
35980,US,"There's an exotic perfumey-ness to this wine that almost suggests patchouli, so relaxed and complex it is. Medium-bodied with an inviting layering of black cherry and stemmy earthiness, it's curiously riddled in white pepper as it finishes.",91,55,California
35990,US,"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak.",91,70,California
36000,France,"The pale rosé color doesn't detract from this concentrated, ripe wine that offers yellow fruits, orange zest and spicy flavors. Pure acidity gives intense freshness and an impressive depth of flavor. The wine will be better after more aging, so drink from late 2016.",91,52,Provence
36010,Israel,"A blend of 88% Sauvignon Blanc and 45% Chardonnay, this is bright and expressive, with forward aromas of white peach, yellow florals, fresh grass and sweet-orange citrus. Those notes carry through to the lively palate, with prickly acidity that keeps the finish crisp and clean.",88,32,Judean Hills
36020,Chile,"This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.",88,18,Cachapoal Valley
36030,France,"With a light touch of spice and some richness, this is a dry style of Pinot Gris. It has a kiwi fruit flavor along with white fruits, and finishes with pepper. Screwcap.",86,18,Alsace
36040,US,"Big and ponderous for a Pinot Noir, almost like Grenache, it's so full-bodied and rich in cherries, mocha, anise and spices. Delicious in its way, but lacks Pinot finesse and subtlety. Drink up.",86,65,California
36050,Italy,"Reale (100% Merlot) offers sweet cherry and raspberry aromas with light touches of spice and toasted almond in the background. This ruby colored wine offers an easy, fresh and lean feel in the mouth.",86,30,Tuscany
36060,US,"In its youth, this wine is tightly wound and austere, despite a wealth of ripe cherry fruit. The acidity and tannins wrap it up in a concealing cloak of dry astringency. But it has the inherent balance to age over the next 10 years, gradually softening and mellowing.",90,40,California
36070,Italy,"Passo del Lupo Riserva delivers personality and surprises thanks to its extremely polished aromas of Indian spice, red berry, natural rubber and cola. The wood integration is lovely, and the wine is both spicy and fresh on the close.",90,40,Central Italy
36080,Portugal,"This single-variety wine from Alorna has a sophisticated quality that's found in the estate's other cuvées. It is structured, with spicy wood accents balancing the black currant flavors. A bitter chocolate note lends an edge to this finely made wine.",89,,Tejo
36090,US,"Considering how pale this Pinot pours, it's surprising how rich it tastes. Wrapped into the delicate, silky texture are peppery, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry toffee, root beer, mocha and caramelized brown sugar flavors. Exotic now, it's probably at its best early on.",88,36,California
36100,US,"This is made in the style of an Aussie Shiraz, a big, powerful wine that stuffs the mouth with fresh, jammy fruit and spice flavors. It's very dry and crisply balanced with acidity, and brings to mind smoky, barbecued meats and poultry.",87,24,California

36130,Italy,"Made entirely with Nerello Mascalese, this charming rosato offers delicate but enticing scents of Spanish broom, aromatic herb and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The bright savory palate doles out wild cherry, strawberry compote, aromatic herb and a saline note alongside refreshing acidity.",89,,Sicily & Sardinia
36140,US,"Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale.",92,27,California
36150,Italy,"Aromas of spiced plum, dark-skinned berry, leather and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, white pepper, game and aniseed alongside firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2015??020.",92,40,Tuscany
36160,France,"This powerful, dense wine has a good, long journey to travel. The 20% wood aging has given a surprising amount of toastiness to the black plum fruit and intense acidity. It needs to age, so drink from 2020.",92,75,Burgundy
36170,Spain,"Earthy, dried-fruit aromas are dessicated, while oaky scents of vanilla and licorice offer complexity. This Garnacha-led blend feels jammy in structure; flavors of plum and raspberry come with herbal notes, while the finish is tangy due to pointed acidity, with strawberry flavors in support.",88,45,Northern Spain
36180,US,"Whiffs of lychee and pink grapefruit accent fresh florals on this slightly off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's plush on the palate with juicy stone-fruit flavors, but also bright with lemony acidity. Finishes elegantly with a murmur of tea-leaf tannins.",88,19,New York
36190,France,"A perfumed wine, it's very fresh and bright with strawberry flavors as well as a delicate touch of tannin. A delicious wine to drink now.",88,22,Burgundy
36200,France,"A beautifully balanced wine that exudes elegance as well as richness. It is drier than previous vintages of Cristal Rosé, yielding a bright, crisp and layered wine. Red fruits are married with orange zest and tight acidity. It can be drunk now, but it is a young wine and will certainly age well through 2022.",96,595,Champagne
36210,France,"Although it is still young, this vintage of Cristal promises great things. There's an impressive balance between ripe fruit and crisp acidity, rich and food friendly, but also a fine apéritif. Apricot and grapefruit flavors are round and rich, but with considerable minerality as well. This is a beautiful wine that can improve with age, at least through 2030.",95,249,Champagne
36220,US,"How this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend manages to be softly delicious, yet structurally brilliant is its mystery and art. The winemaker took grapes from St. Helena, Howell Mountain, Rutherford and Yountville and blended them seamlessly. It's one of the most opulent wines of the vintage with blackberry, currant and mineral flavors set like jewels in a crown of tannins.",94,200,California
36230,US,"Earthy aromas of black loam and graphite give complexity to accents of beet juice and dried purple flowers on this wine by longtime Rideau Winery winemaker Andres Ibarra, who also manages La Presa Vineyard. Deep purple florals of violet and lavender hit the palate along with cooked peppercorns, sweet plums and spiced cherries, making for an elegant and complex package.",92,42,California
36240,Portugal,"The most famous grape of the Douro has produced a beautifully aromatic wine, ripe and structured. The black plum fruits are finely matched with solid tannins and firm character of this ageworthy wine. Drink from 2018.",92,45,Douro
36250,US,"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint.",92,125,California
36260,US,"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine shows the ripe, sweet softness of Paso Robles in a hot vintage. It's forward in blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate and peppery spice flavors, with firm tannins.",87,44,California
36270,Italy,"This is a pure expression of Merlot from Northeast Italy with pretty mineral tones that act as a frame to plump cherry, blackberry jam and almond. The wine has a chewy, dense mouthfeel and could pair with meatloaf or steaks.",87,15,Northeastern Italy
36280,South Africa,"A dancing, lively nose of citrus and slate is balanced by more lush aromas of tropical fruit and peach here. Full-bodied guava and pineapple flavors have a touch of floral elegance here, and a spiced backbone. Unique and pretty.",87,23,Swartland
36290,Austria,"Ripe Golden Pearmain apples and juicy, red-cheeked Comice pears are infinitely inviting on the nose, the fullish palate is more restrained and toned, fresh and zippy, channeling richness into concentrated length with a wonderfully lip-smacking, delicious finish.",90,,Nieder?sterreich
36300,Italy,"Opening aromas recall underbrush, red berry, white mushroom, truffle and thyme with a whiff of leather. The palate offers restrained wild cherry accented with white pepper, mint and sage alongside tightly knit tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, this wine isn't made for long-term cellaring. Drink 2015??019.",90,57,Tuscany
36310,US,"Supple and very lightly toasty, this pleasant Chardonnay offers green banana, pear and peach fruit flavors. All are modest in scale and well-integrated, with a lick of toffee from aging in 20% new French oak. It thins out quickly through the finish.",87,25,Oregon
36320,US,"Young, bright raspberry fruit brings fresh, forward flavors front and center. There's a touch of cherry Popsicle also. It's an undeniably pretty wine, ready to drink, though don't look for much in the way of either depth or concentration.",87,30,Oregon
36330,US,"This unusual blend, all co-fermented, includes roughly equal proportions of Vermentino, Viognier and Marsanne, with a splash of Roussanne. It's perfumed with the intensity of Gewürztraminer, a mix of baby powder and candied citrus, and those flavors carry through the palate. Though listed as just 12.5% abv, it tastes and feels much riper, showing some heat in the aftertaste.",87,34,Oregon
36340,US,"This is Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills fruit, delicately managed, so as not to overwhelm the fruit. The strawberry/raspberry sweetness is there, and a wash of molasses carries it into a smooth, luscious finish. The wine is not complex—just very tasty.",88,32,Washington
36350,Chile,"Very deep in color and aromas, this slams you with black fruit, herbs and saucy oak aromas. The palate is stable, with dark prune, fruit cake and acidity giving it an extra burst of life. Finishes with some faux oak flavor, butter, pepper and heat. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA, Inc.",88,18,Rapel Valley
36360,France,"This 100% Syrah is a bit tough and chewy on the finish, but also has lots of black-cherry fruit upfront and a suave, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Imported by Routas USA.",87,18,Provence
36370,Italy,"Made with Garganega grapes and fermented in large casks and barriques, this features aromas of toasted oak and candied fruit. The palate offers baked yellow apple, dried apricot, butterscotch and nectarine peel alongside soft acidity.",88,20,Veneto
36380,US,"Tasted shortly after bottling, this needed some airing to blow off the sulfur. Once open it showed itself to be a palate-pleasing, round and spicy wine, elaborating its pear fruit with notes of orange peel and Meyer lemon.",88,20,Oregon
36390,US,"Chalky tannins and dried herb mark the entry of this wine, which stays varietal despite the addition of 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sage, peppercorn and high-toned cherry complete the picture, with well-integrated, generous tannins framing the overall picture, finishing in swirls of cinnamon and vanilla.",88,42,California
36400,France,"This fresh and flavorful rosé is as easy to like as its gentle price tag. There's loads of youthful strawberry and peach fruit, propped up by a bright line of acidity that carries the flavors through to a medium finish. Pick this for your next warm weather gathering.",87,11,Provence
36410,US,"Clean, brisk and balanced, with good varietal flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and exotic tropical fruits, brightened with zesty acidity. This is a good price for a classic California Chardonnay.",87,13,California

36440,US,"This is the inaugural release of this Clifton Hill and Clifton Bluff vineyards wine. Aromas of plum, dark berries, pencil lead and chocolate precede soft, plump fruit flavors. It goes down far too easy.",88,25,Washington
36450,Chile,"Prickly aromas of nettle and green herbs are matched by spicy blackberry and lactic oak notes. A tight, tannic palate is firmly built, with spicy flavors of cherry and cassis as well as olive. A peppery, herbal, toasty finish sends this on its way. Drink through 2018.",88,19,Maipo Valley

36480,US,"Oaky bacon and barbecue smoke make for a burly wine-drinking experience in this full-bodied, expressive and somewhat heavy offering from the Dry Creek winery's estate.",85,25,California
36490,Spain,"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",94,248,Northern Spain
36500,US,"Despite the silly name, this is a deeply impressive, but very young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It needs time in the cellar. It practically oozes ripe, pie-filling blackberries and cherries as well as sweet, smoky new oak. It's all primary flavor now, but very balanced, and should come into its own after 2010.",93,125,California
36510,US,"A rare finding of this variety in California, this wine is golden-orange in color and offers resin-like sweetness that may not appeal to everybody.",83,25,California
36520,Moldova,"This sparkling red wine made from Muscat is cherry red in color. It has pleasant aromas and flavors of red raspberry, black cherry and sweet pomegranate juice. It could use a few more bubbles but it will satisfy the palates of wine drinkers looking for sweet red sparkling wines.",82,9,Moldova
36530,France,"Salon's releases are rare and signify a great vintage—the last release was the 2002. Coming from grand cru vineyards in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this 2004 is complex and concentrated, capturing the essence of Chardonnay in Champagne. Intense minerality and ripe apple and citrus fruits accompany the purity and crisp texture that are part of its ability to age. The wine can continue for many years, certainly to 2025 and beyond.",98,520,Champagne
36540,US,"It brings a Northwest Cabernet profile of black currant, plum, licorice and light herbs with medium-bodied feel. A touch of sweetness rounds out the finish.",85,11,Washington
36550,US,"Broad aromas of espresso and dark cherry carry onto the medium- to full-bodied palate, which comes with an edgy texture due in part to the elevated acids.",84,29,Virginia
36560,Spain,"Dense, earthy, inky aromas of raisin and schisty minerals are a good introduction to a well-packed palate that's pumping out wild berry flavors along with blackened toast accents. A medium-length finish brings this flavorful, stacked blend of Garnacha, Mazuelo (Carignan) and Syrah to a good close.",90,17,Catalonia
36570,US,"Showing excellent concentration and structure, this sharply etched wine sets vivid fruit flavors of raspberries and pie cherries against buoyant acidity. The focus is excellent, right on through a crisp finish.",90,20,Washington
36580,France,"Something different, the fruit for this wine comes off 80-year-old Carignan vines. The result is an intensely concentrated wine that mixes raspberry and blueberry fruit with delicate herbal shadings. It's full-bodied, but supple and easy to drink, ending on a note of dark chocolate. Drink now??018.",90,40,Rh?ne Valley
36590,US,"This is a juicy, mid-weight and lengthy version of the variety, elegantly crafted with highlights of cherry and cranberry as well as integrated layers of earthy forest floor. Lengthy, it drinks well on its own but will star with the right food, especially pork.",92,39,California
36600,Austria,"Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!",92,27,Wachau
36610,US,"This is such a refreshing take on the variety, still robust and rich in body, yet possessed of firm acidity and a crispness of cherry kirsch and pomegranate. It practically shouts violets and roses on the nose, following through on the palate with a delicacy of power that's entirely surprising. The finish is a mix of allspice and white pepper.",92,50,California
36620,US,"A 100% varietal wine, this still has a puckering sense to the tannins, the power and weight of the wine generous and robust. Leather and banana figure into the bouquet, with the savory-laden flavors leaning toward black pepper and dark, ripe plum. This wine needs time; cellar through 2022.",91,68,California
36630,US,"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018??024.",91,48,California
36640,New Zealand,"“Delicate??is how owner-winemaker Larry McKenna describes Pahi, and that seems apt. It's smoky and vaguely herbal, hinting at tomato, then offers cherry fruit and soft, gentle tea-like tannins that turn silky on the finish. Drink now??021.",91,59,Martinborough
36650,Germany,"Sweet-tart tangerine and quince are shaded in deep folds of smoke, crushed slate and pollen in this nuanced wine. Savory spice and earth tones are prominent now, but a core of pristine honey and citrus notes pulse from within. Concentrated and composed with radiant lemon-lime acidity, it's likely to improve with bottle age. Hold till at least 2020.",92,52,Mosel
36660,US,"Young and compact, this well-made, single vineyard Pinot is layered with cranberry, raspberry and black-cherry fruit. Tannins remain a bit stiff, and the acids assertive, with a muscular, tannic finish. Give this a bit more cellar time, and drink 2020??030.",92,60,Oregon
36670,US,"The first vintage for this re-branded, mid-level Ponzi Pinot is a doozy. Lovely aromatics offer a plush potpourri of plum, blueberry and cherry fruit, along with hints of curry, chocolate and hickory chips. Flavors are nicely entwined, round and full bodied, with a streak of root beer. This is ready to enjoy now and over the next couple of years.",92,43,Oregon
36680,Germany,"Stone, smoke and mineral oil aromas juxtapose deeply concentrated flavors of peach, tangerine and quince on the palate of this deftly balanced Riesling. While dry in style, it's lusciously mouth-filling, suggesting swirls of honey and citrus. A long, steel-touched finish dries everything up nicely. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2022 and likely beyond.",91,27,Mosel
36690,France,"Here's true “old vine??wine—from vines 75 years old on average—and it is ripe and toasty, with flavors of almonds, spice and baked bread. Fresh, crisp apples and green plums are lifted by a citrus aftertaste. Drink this attractive wine now.",91,45,Burgundy
36700,Israel,"Dark garnet to the eye, this wine offers a bouquet of blackberry, blueberry and menthol. There is a sense of coolness on the palate amid flavors of cassis, blackberry, lavender, eucalyptus, aniseed and iodine. A smooth web of tannins fills the mouth, lingering past the bright yet soft finish.",91,70,Upper Galilee
36710,Spain,"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",84,21,Northern Spain
36720,Argentina,"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",84,12,Mendoza Province
36730,US,"The fruit for this wine is sourced from the former Sandhill Vineyard on Red Mountain. The nose is pretty and enticing, but the palate shows a sour note. There seems to be a separation between the first berry flavors and the tight, quick finish. Perhaps more time in bottle will meld it together.",86,39,Washington
36740,US,"Smooth, mellow and dry, this features savory flavors of blackberry jam, cola, licorice and baking spice. It's a sound red wine for drinking with everyday fare.",85,20,California
36750,US,"Dry and rough in texture, this has earthy flavors of coffee, cherry and spice. The tannins are a little uneven and green. Drink up.",85,26,California
36760,US,"This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy! In a world where so many Oregon wineries are making Pinot Noir that is superripe, extracted and alcoholic, this shows why the Burgundy comparison is still valid.",86,35,Oregon
36770,Italy,"This Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Sangioveto blend is a bit thorny and sharp because high notes of black peppercorn, cola and pine forest seem to rise above the wine's natural fruit.",86,24,Tuscany
36780,Spain,"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",86,12,Northern Spain
36790,US,"A powerful Cabernet rich in black fruit, cinnamon and a backbone of mild tannin, Freakshow is robust and grippy, the finish showy in vanilla and smoky oak.",85,20,California
36800,US,"Robust and full-bodied, this wine shows Petite Sirah's black currant and pepper flavors in a softly tannic way that makes it fully drinkable now. It's great with barbecue and stews.",85,13,California
36810,US,"If this Sauvignon Blanc were drier, the score would soar. It's brilliantly crisp with acidity and clean, with blood orange, pineapple, gooseberry and lime flavors. It's intensely minerally, but distinctly lush and ripe, which limits its versatility with food.",85,22,California
36820,France,"Bone dry and crisp, this is also has fruitiness from the ripeness of the grapes, giving impressively rich apple and pear flavors. Of course, these are cut by tight acidity and intense citrus, leaving a tight, steely aftertaste.",89,49,Champagne

37960,Uruguay,"Lightweight, almost dilute aromas of pool water, ocean brine and mild citrus are less than stunning. This Albari?o is plump and melony, with a shot of citric acidity. Briny flavors of orange and tropical fruits finish steady, with no slippage.",85,17,Uruguay

37980,Canada,"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue.

37990,US,"This self-described, entry-level blend boasts floral aromatics and spicy, peppery fruit flavors of cranberry, strawberry and raspberry. Ribbon Ridge Pinots show great character, especially when from estate-grown, biodynamically-certified grapes like this offering.",92,34,Oregon

There is tons of tingly acidity on the palate, along with flavors of tobacco, marjoram, dewy oregano and barely ripe cherry tomato. Drink 2020??030.",92,34,California
38010,Germany,"Why shouldn't Pfalz producers cash in on the Pinot Noir craze? This is a commendable version, offering earthy, herbal aromas and a base of black cherry fruit. It's plump and nicely rounded, with a soft, mushroomy finish.",87,22,Pfalz
38020,US,"Ultra-rich, with chocolate-infused dark berry flavors, splashed with cassis and accented with smoky new oak. Although the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry, it's soft, which accentuates the alcohol, making it taste a bit hot and unbalanced.",87,100,California
38030,Argentina,"Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020.",90,19,Other

38070,US,"Good, rich and earthy, a dark, full-bodied wine with olive, earth, tobacco and plum flavors and dense but accessible tannins. Strikes a balanced note, not a hedonistic blockbuster, but elegantly drinkable tonight. Might soften and improve with a few years in the cellar.",89,25,California
38080,US,"Southern Oregon, unlike the northern Willamette Valley, is warm and conducive to growing Bordeaux varieties, as evidenced by this hearty, tannic blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Right away you get kirsch and cassis from this heavyweight, and that's followed by a ripe palate that blasts loudly with plum and chocolate. Along the way there are some drying tannins and pulsating acids, so either lay it down for a couple of years or decant and serve with grilled meats.",89,30,Oregon
38090,France,"This exotic, spicy wine's wood flavors give it a lively character. This is a medium-bodied wine, not heavy in any sense, its fruitiness and attractive acidity producing a wine that will soon be ready to drink.",89,20,Bordeaux

It's a fine food wine that'll impress and improve as the meal goes on.",90,32,California
38300,France,"Rich, elegant and classic, this wine is made from fruit sourced from old vines—some as much as 70 years old. It has a tannic structure, but the dominant elements are the dense red- and black-plum flavors, which are supported by the wine's acids. Age it for 5?? years.",91,,Burgundy

There is the tang of zest and the bright juiciness of lemon fruit. The palate is concentrated and taut, submerging any earthy tones to end in brisk, clean freshness.",90,27,Alsace
38370,Portugal,"The wine comes from the high plateau north of the Douro. A field blend, the wine was trodden by foot in open stone lagars. That technique gives the wine its full, rich and open character. In contrast, the tannins and the bold fruit are very ripe, perhaps too much so, with the hint of pepper on the tongue from the alcohol. The wine, though, is finished with plenty of acidity. Drink from 2018.",90,60,Trás-os-Montes

38440,US,"This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here.

38470,Australia,"So green and peppery on the nose it seems jalape?o-like. There is plenty of citrus fruit as well, giving a slightly disjointed impression a this early age.

38490,Argentina,"Minty boysenberry aromas show modest minerality. The palate feels acidic and clipped, while angular berry flavors lead the charge. A minty, peppery finish comes with scouring acidity, so this needs food.",85,16,Mendoza Province
38500,Italy,"Aromas of blueberry jam, scorched earth, leather, truffle and coffee lead the way on this ripe, accessible wine. The chewy palate offers fleshy blackberry, anise, toast, espresso and a confectionary note alongside mature but rather fleeting tannins. Drink 2016??020.",89,40,Tuscany
38510,US,"The raspberry aromas are bright and jammy. The flavors are sumptuous yet elegant, going down easy.",89,30,Idaho
38520,France,"This wine is still young, tight and on the crisp acid side. That doesn't mean it won't soften and fill out, although it will probably stay ultrafresh and packed with red-currant flavors for some time. Wait to drink until 2018.",89,40,Burgundy
38530,Italy,"At 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this is a sculpted, perfumed second-vintage red with cranberry as well as cherry fruit and well-integrated oak.

It's not old-school, but you'd still have to call it a traditional Tuscan wine.",92,32,Tuscany
38540,Italy,"Sandro Chia's winery is known not only for its reliable and enjoyable wines, but also for the art series labels—work from his New York and Montalcino studios—for each vintage.

The wine will age well—coming to maturity in 10 years or more—but will surely be drinkable in five.",92,55,Tuscany
38550,Italy,"The name is a play on words. Merli is the plural of “blackbirds,??and this wine is 100% Merlot. But it isn't for the birds. Black as night in the glass, with a brooding power that's confirmed on the palate. What's special about it is that unlike so many flabby Merlots, it carries Chianti-like acidity and an unbridled raciness. Excellent now with food, and it will age well, too.",91,89,Tuscany
38560,US,"A blend every year of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, the 2010 is rich and spicy, rounded with soft tannins and prime red raspberry and cherry fruit. Well integrated, a layering of chocolate, coffee and clove finish the wine off nicely.",89,34,California

38610,Spain,"Familiar aromas of black fruit, licorice and earth get it going, followed by saturated body weight that reaches all corners of the mouth while displaying earthy, chunky blackberry and black cherry flavors. Flush, comfortable and slightly heavy. Drink now through 2012.",88,20,Northern Spain
38620,Spain,"Light cherry and berry aromas are a bit candied, and the palate is more so. It's almost sugary sweet, but fortunately the wine has good acidity and bounce, so it's not cloying or sticky. Definitely for fans of white Zin and other sweet rosés.",84,13,Catalonia

38650,Chile,"Dark, smoky aromas of freshly laid pavement come with leathery berry scents along with wood and eucalyptus notes.

38690,Italy,"This opens with a subtle, refined fragrance of perfumed berry, rose, violet and a whiff of sweet baking spice. On the palate, notes of roasted herb, tobacco and white pepper add depth to the core of ripe dark cherry and crushed raspberry. Bracing but refined tannins provide the framework and need time to unwind.",92,38,Piedmont

That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage. But it's a fabulous Cabernet to drink now, and it will reward cellaring for 10 years.",95,175,California
39000,Portugal,"Tightly herbal and packed with green fruits, this is a full and ripe wine. It is still very young with its initial fruit flavors still intact. It will calm down over the next few months and be better to drink from 2017.",85,12,Tejo
39010,France,There is plenty of red fruit here. The tannins are firm with a dry core and hints of bitterness. That needs to settle down so that the essential fruitiness of the wine can shine.,85,18,Bordeaux
39020,Spain,"Aromas of roasted, grapy berry fruits come with oak-based notes of plastic and clove. This wine feels full in body, with hard tannins. Flavors of woodspice, hickory and black fruits finish with a lingering hint of wood smoke.",85,11,Northern Spain
39030,Spain,"The nose on this Garnacha Blanca is funky and blends aromas of cured ham and salami with lees and citrus. The palate feels right, with solid acidity. Flavors of tangerine, gooseberry and nectarine end pulpy and citric, with a touch of green herbs.",87,17,Catalonia
39040,France,"Delicate and dainty, this pretty selection boasts soft aromas and flavors of white cherry, bergamot tea, orange rind and hard peach. Light weight and refreshing, the lively acidity keeps the palate brisk and the fruit flavors fresh.",87,11,Languedoc-Roussillon
39050,US,"There are said to be fewer than 100 acres of Teroldego in California, so this one is worth trying. Midweight and fruity, it has lavender, anise and leather lightly folded into the mix. A good wine to start the evening and enjoy by the glass.",87,24,California
39060,US,"This is a bright, effusive, estate-grown, unfiltered white, delineated by high-toned acidity and gorgeously floral aromatics. Planted originally in 1975 to heritage Wente clone Chardonnay by owner/winemaker Tom Dehlinger, its generosity of fresh apple and pear ride a voluptuous, balanced texture that's wholly satisfying, before meeting deeper hues of spicy, exotic tropical tones on the finish.",95,40,California
39070,Italy,"Iris, violet, steeped cherry, camphor and underbrush aromas come together in the glass. The chewy, succulent palate offers red cherry, raspberry, aromatic herb and star anise while firm but refined tannins provide backbone and a velvety mouthfeel. It boasts balance, freshness and body. Drink 2018 through 2025.",94,45,Piedmont
39080,US,"Shea is one of the Willamette Valley's most revered sites, and an all-star list of wineries compete for the fruit. Here the bright flavors of ripe raspberries are elevated with tangy acids, putting a tight frame of citrus around the core. A whiff of sea breeze comes up as well, enticing the taster to explore a bit more deeply. Already irresistible, this evocative wine will cellar well for at least a decade. Drink now through 2028.",94,55,Oregon
39090,US,"Pale straw in color, this wine brings alluring aromas of toast, spice, clarified butter and stone fruit. The palate is full bodied with sweet, generous peach and tropical-fruit flavors that sail on the finish.",91,35,Washington
39100,France,"Yellow peach, honeysuckle and russet pear combine in a very inviting nose. The palate amalgamates these flavors even more, bathing them in tangy but sightly sweet orange notes. The result is a bullet of flavor and freshness, balanced, friendly and very moreish. The finish is off dry and wonderfully clean and spicy.",91,23,Alsace
39110,US,"This brooding, brawny wine made from mountain fruit is all about mushroom and compost notes—a true expression of the vineyard's surroundings. Black cherry fruit and youthful tannins provide context, with a sizzling streak of acidity.",91,50,California
39120,Spain,"Oaky spice, vanilla and dried-cherry aromas are classic Rioja. This feels round and good, with dry tannins and bright acidity. Toasty brown-sugar and chocolate notes grace mild red-fruit flavors on this textbook wine. Drink through 2020.",89,15,Northern Spain
39130,Italy,"Chopped herbs, white almond and citrus zest aromas take shape on this luminous wine. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, grapefruit and mineral alongside racy acidity and a persistent perlage. An almond note backs up the finish.",89,20,Veneto
39140,Italy,"Bright and fragrant, this offers scents of acacia, herbs and stone fruit accented by a hint of nuts. The bright palate offers white peach, green apple and citrus framed in vibrant acidity together with a frothy mousse.",89,20,Veneto
39150,US,"Juicy red fruit that flirts in cherry and vanilla opens this complex, florally aromatic wine from the Rudd Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Thick, integrated tannins support a concentrated structure, marked by herb and cedar, finishing dry and lean.",88,60,California

39180,US,"Beet juice, cinnamon, clove and turned earth show on the nose of this bottling from Malibu-based winemaker Jim Palmer. The palate offers dusty leather, raspberry fruit, dried herbs and a chalky texture, cut by moderate acidity.",88,65,California
39190,France,The slightest notion of honeysuckle reaches the nose. The light and dry palate diffuses the aromatic notions of Muscat only slightly. There is lovely lightness and lots of lemon freshness.,88,23,Alsace
39200,US,"From estate-grown Pommard clone fruit, this wine shows earthy forest notes against moderate acidity and mellow oak. Medium-bodied, it plays well on the palate with a balance of cranberry and clove flavors.",88,42,California
39210,US,"The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",89,30,Washington
39220,Italy,"Forest floor, new leather, tobacco and crushed herb aromas emerge in the glass. It's youthfully austere and a bit lean, with sour cherry, pomegranate, sage and white pepper framed in vibrant acidity and assertive fine-grained tannins. Drink 2023??035.",89,,Piedmont
39230,France,"This is a cave cooperative's top white Crozes bottling, fermented and aged in oak. Smoky, toasty notes support exotic apricot and pineapple fruit that's initially attractive, then doesn't quite follow through on the finish. Drink now.",89,42,Rh?ne Valley
39240,US,"The malolactic fermentation on this unoaked wine was blocked, so this is brimming with pure orange and lime flavors. The acidity is brisk and clean.",87,18,California
39250,US,"Smooth, rich and mellow, this has flavors of chocolate, raspberry, cherry and buttered toast that almost taste sweet. The tannins and acids eventually kick in, and the finish turns nicely dry. Drink now.",87,26,California
39260,US,"This Pinot is starting to lose its primary fruit, and it's gradually becoming mushroomy and earthy. But the raspberry and cherry flavors are still plentiful, and the finish is dry and clean. It's an interesting, complex wine to drink now.",87,53,California
39270,US,"From a superior block at the Red Willow vineyard, this pure Syrah was aged in 100% new French oak. It's concentrated and tangy, with wild berry fruit streaked with oolong tea, licorice, dark chocolate and coffee liqueur.",91,45,Washington
39280,France,"Now mature, this smoky, wood-aged wine is rich and complex. It has firm and dry tannins that are typical of the Tannat although these are a part of a solid, dark wine. The aftertaste brings out a perfumed, rich side that is attractive. The wine is ready to drink.",91,38,Southwest France
39290,US,"A true sensation. Shows the richness and concentration you want in a great Napa Cab, but also a structure that lifts it above the soft, mushy wines that are so prevalent. There's real tannin and acid architecture framing the opulent blackberry, black currant, mineral and cedar flavors, and the finish is dry, dry, dry. Every sip offers something different as it changes in the glass. A world-class wine that defines elegance, power and complexity. Should age effortlessly for at least a decade.",97,150,California
39300,Italy,In terms of overall quality this is the best yet from this sea-facing estate in coastal Tuscany. The blend sees Cabernet Sauvignon enhanced by Merlot and Cabernet Franc and the overall effect is one of impressive intensity and sophistication. The finish is velvety rich and smooth.,95,60,Tuscany
39310,Austria,"Fresh, superripe as well as candied pineapple combine to give utter opulence to this rich and viscous wine. The longer you taste, the more intense—almost heady—these tropical flavors become. What is more, as an ice wine untainted by any botrytis, this shines with purity and drive, and has astonishing acidity that keeps this just on the right side of paradise.",94,,Vienna
39320,US,"This deftly hits on all cylinders, delivering big fruit, firm acid, fresh mineral and rich, toasty new-barrel highlights. Juicy, textural and deep, it's a wine to gulp, to savor and to share.",94,38,Washington

39340,Spain,"This wine's suntan lotion aromas and mild volatility are a bit disconcerting. On the palate, it's full and dark, with abrasive, rubbery tannins and jammy currant and black cherry flavors that finish strong.",87,9,Northern Spain
39350,US,"This is a well-proportioned, pleasantly balanced wine made from white Rh?ne grape varieties. It has plenty of fruit and a smooth, almost soft texture. Fresh apple and pear aromas meet nutmeg and vanilla flavors on the palate.",87,26,California
39360,US,"Densely packed rose, black cherries, sandalwood and a flash of pepper show in this bottling—a new project featuring a risqué label by Peachy Canyon. Pepper, smoke and roasted pork are evident on the dry palate, alongside a hint of lilac.",91,38,California
39370,Australia,"This wine shows a grape jelly note that might be a little on the ripe side, but the cedary, cigar box characters balance things out beautifully. The palate is medium bodied, with a long line of focused acidity, herbs, an earthy core and a long cigar-box finish.",91,25,South Australia
39380,France,"With 30% of the harvest aged in new oak, this is a spicy, toasty wine. That shows through in the firm tannins that back up the rich black fruit. Produced from 30-year-old vines, it has concentration and a fine, solid texture. Drink from 2022.",91,45,Bordeaux
39390,US,"Tart and tangy, these recently grafted Riesling vines deliver just-ripe flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, grapefruit and pineapple. It's close to a fruit bomb, but the significant acid underpinning keeps it juicy and gives it extra lift.",92,28,Oregon
39400,US,"A handful of Pritchard Hill Petit Verdot adds color and vibrancy to this impressive wine, sinewy in leather, black pepper and robust cigar. Currant and cedar highlights make for a classic profile, with firm, integrated tannin in support. This wine should do well in the cellar, finding its peak between 2021 and 2023.",92,85,California
39410,France,"The famous nonvintage from Louis Roederer has evolved and become just that little bit drier. This bottling emphasizes white fruits and crisp acidity as well as mineral texture. It is a complete wine, all the elements there. Another few months bottle age will make this wine even better, so wait until 2017.",92,54,Champagne
39420,US,"The nose is packed with dark notes of desiccated strawberry, red currant and caramel lozenge, plus dried herb and maduro subtleties. Astringent, lip-grabbing tannins bolster the fleshy, medium- to full-bodied palate. A few more years of bottle aging should help mitigate some of the tannic blow, but enjoy it now with a brief decanting and a slab of grilled meat.",90,50,Virginia
39430,France,"Big and ripe, this is structured with fine acids, rich berry fruits and firm tannins. The ensemble is full bodied, juicy and elegant, finishing with crisp flavors of red cherry and pepper.",90,,Beaujolais
39440,France,"Dense and concentrated, with a mint flavor from the new wood, this is a wine that combines rich plum and blackberry flavors with firm tannins and juicy acids. Because it is so rich, it is likely to be ready to be drink in the next 2?? years.",90,24,Southwest France
39450,US,"Shows very bright acidity and a firm minerality, which gives it a tangy, mouthwatering vitality. Rich, too, in lemondrop candy, pineapple jam and spice flavors. The oak has been tastefully applied, with just- right notes of buttered toast. A flattering, balanced, elegant Chardonnay for drinking soon.",93,30,California
39460,Spain,"Licorice, schist, wild herbs and spicy berry fruit form an alluring bouquet. The palate is jammy but firm, with mouthfilling tannins and schisty flavors of blackberry that come with a fine herbal streak. Meaty and tannic but balanced and deep; a classy taste of Priorat to drink now through 2018.",93,95,Catalonia
39470,Spain,"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now??020.",91,30,Levante
39480,France,"Viognier from the Southern Rh?ne can often be overripe and heavy, but while this offering from Grand Veneur is full bodied and richly textured, it remains reasonably fresh. Apricot, pineapple and passion fruit flavors mingle easily on the palate, finishing clean and long. Drink now.",90,25,Rh?ne Valley
39490,Chile,"Warm, earthy and stewed smelling, but then sharp and tangy and acidic in the mouth. Red fruits are dominant, but there's a persistent scour to the wine that doesn't allow it to get to the next level of quality or ripeness.",83,10,Colchagua Valley
39500,US,"Simple, with jammy pineapple, mango and vanilla cream flavors that finish sugary sweet.",82,12,California
39510,Bulgaria,"Though pleasant aromatically with lots of freshly cut grass and gooseberry notes, this full-bodied, dry Bulgarian Sauvignon Blanc has a dense, clunky mouthfeel and a bracingly high acidity. There's some decent lemon and grapefruit flavors, but plenty of tinned green asparagus as well.",82,9,Bulgaria
39520,US,"There's something softly seductive about this Cabernet. Its tannins are finely ground and acidity is low, resulting in a melted, velvety mouthfeel. The flavors are just fine, of black cherries and cedar.",87,20,California
39530,US,"A nice, flavorful and dry Syrah for drinking now with barbecue or a rich lamb or beef stew. Soft and gentle, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, beef jerky, pepper and smoky oak.",87,20,California
39540,US,"High alcohol of 20% makes this dessert wine hot in the mouth. That's the main impression, because the sweetness and fruit aren't quite strong enough to balance the heat. Nonetheless it's pretty sweet, with blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.",87,40,California
39550,France,"This feels light and rather dilute. It has varietal pepper and some spice, but the main effect is one of acidity, crispness and freshness. The lychee tropical fruit element is underplayed in favor of crispness. It should certainly work with food.",87,25,Alsace
39560,US,"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry. Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.",88,36,California
39570,US,"Dry, tannic and impressive for its depth of fruit, showing blackberry, chocolate and currant flavors that veer into overripe raisins, which gives some bitterness to the finish. The mouthfeel is a little hot in alcohol, but creamy smooth. Hard to say where this wine is going, so drink over the next four years.",88,115,California
39580,US,"A solid Cabernet from this hot appellation, located well inland in Sonoma County. The wine is dry, tannic and fairly high in alcohol, although it wears its heat well. The fruit is very ripe in the direction of black currants and dark chocolate. Will hold and change over the next 6?? years, turning drier and earthier, but you can drink it now.",88,50,California
39590,Italy,"There are raw, bright qualities of cherry liqueur and raspberry syrup that open the nose. It shows solid and polished tannins.",88,16,Southern Italy
39600,Portugal,"This finely structured wine from the Quinta dos Murcas estate has ripe flavors of spice and red berry. Its warm feel is shot through with acidity for the perfect amount of tension. You can drink this now, but it would benefit from another year of aging.",88,13,Douro
39610,Italy,"The Colli Euganei is an up-and-coming wine region located in a volcanic chain of hills outside the city of Padua. This expression of Moscato is sweet and enduring, with aromas of yellow rose and jasmine.",88,50,Veneto
39620,US,"Cinnamon and spearmint elements give depth to the pinpoint, laser-sharp fruit notes of cherry blossom and strawberry on this bottling. Strong herbal flavors of thyme and marjoram and spices of green cardamom of peppercorn hit the palate right away, seasoning cranberry and pomegranate fruit, and finishing on a slate minerality.",92,55,California
39630,US,"A fabulous, relatively affordable way to break into this cult winery, this blend of 30% Syrah, 26% Carignane, 22% Grenache, 19% Mourvèdre and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon offers teriyaki, char, fresh fennel, scarlet-red roses, anise, pencil lead and black raspberry on the nose.

The medium tannins are approachable, making this easy to drink right now.",91,34,California
39650,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",92,52,California
39660,US,"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",91,34,California
39670,France,"This rich, rounded wine shows ripe yellow fruits, pineapple flavors and a texture that just hints at minerality. All this rich fruit is so generously balanced with acidity and a juicy, fruity and fresh aftertaste. At the same time, the wine has weight, depth of flavor and a background structure that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",93,,Burgundy
39680,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, game, woodland berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The youthful, tightly wound palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, chopped herb, clove and tobacco alongside firm, noble tannins and bright acidity. Oliver McCrum Wines and Petit Pois.",93,48,Piedmont
39690,France,"Produced from old vines, this is a beautiful wine. It has great structure, minerality and concentration along with a full-bodied richness that is developing well.

39700,US,"The grapes are from an old vineyard on the warmer eastern side of Russian River Valley, in the Mayacamas foothills. The wine is exceptionally ripe, with blackberries veering into prunes and raisins. The tannins are wonderfully smooth and complex. Drink it now with barbecue.",87,45,California
39710,France,"A blend of Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc fields a full-bodied wine, with a touch of bitter almonds, citrus fruit and soft, floral aftertaste. It is a dry wine, with an attractive apple skin texture and crisp acidity at the end.",87,25,Loire Valley
39720,Italy,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this starts with aromas of red berry, blue flower and spice. The juicy palate serves up black cherry and cinnamon-spice along with notes of espresso. It's soft and one-dimensional but delicious none the less.",87,18,Tuscany
39730,Italy,"This opens with aromas suggesting toast, menthol, steeped cherry and a whiff of iris. The palate is rather shy, showing oak, licorice and clove but not much fruit richness. Bracing tannins clench the finish. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink up.",88,70,Piedmont
39740,US,"Savory bramble and crushed-mineral tones lend complexity to ripe flavors of blueberry and plum on the palate of this wine. Medium bodied in style, it's balanced by a streak of cranberry acidity on the midpalate and rigid, fine-grained tannins.",88,35,New York
39750,Spain,"Aromas of cassis and brandied cherry are rich and full but not overly complex. Flush and ripe on the palate, with tough tannins, this tastes of baked berry fruits. After that, a slight raisiny note blends with latent cassis on a ripe finish.",88,18,Northern Spain
39760,US,"A vegetal note drags down the enjoyment. On the plus side, the wine is nice and silky, with good acidity and raspberry, cherry and fig flavors. But that tug of asparagus is a problem.",84,39,California
39770,France,"The 2004 vintage is certainly mature, but with a light touch it is still attractive to drink. Mushroom and spice are lifted by juicy acidity. The dryness at the end shows it is ready to drink.",84,55,Bordeaux
39780,US,"Peppery and bright, this carries tart flavors of wild berries and mountain herbs. The penetrating peppery character is its most defining attribute.",87,36,Washington
39790,Italy,"BlanQ advertises itself as the perfect aperitivo, or cocktail wine, and this billing is right on the money. The bouquet is redolent of summer flowers, melon and peach and there's a nice creaminess here, provoked in part by the Sicilian sunshine.",87,,Sicily & Sardinia
39800,Argentina,"Rooty aromas of tree bark, cola, tobacco and sweet briar set up a plump, tannic palate with roasted, sweet flavors of Mission fig, dark berry and spice. It's easygoing and loamy on the finish, with chewy tannins and not too much bite.",87,14,Mendoza Province
39810,Portugal,"A superior Vinho Verde, elegant and full-bodied. The creamy texture is partnered with ripe apricot and pear fruits, a touch of green plum and a feeling of opulence along with the acidity. Drink now, or age a year.",91,19,Vinho Verde
39820,US,"This 100% varietal wine is one of the best Viognier buys in California. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with slightly oaky notes accenting ripe flavors of peaches, limes, apricots and honeydew. This would be a good buy at twice the price.",90,16,California
39830,France,"This single-vineyard wine is a showcase of ripeness—fruity and smooth with great plum and wild strawberry flavors. It's intensely structured and dense on the palate, however, making it a wine for aging. Drink from 2016.",90,77,Burgundy
39840,Argentina,"Melon and stone-fruit aromas are minerally and mild, with no overt fruit or oaky aromas sticking out. Crisp, citric and still a touch oily in feel, this tastes of briny citrus fruits, popcorn and salt. On the finish, this shows good body along with lasting salty citrus flavors.",87,25,Mendoza Province
39850,Argentina,"Soupy berry aromas with cheesy oak notes make for an earthy, challenging nose. This feels full, grabby and highly tannic. Medicinal berry and cherry flavors are accented by brown-sugar sweetness and chocolaty spice on the finish.",87,20,Mendoza Province

39870,US,"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting.",84,25,California
39880,Italy,"This light-colored Cortese is an easy-going white that manages to be both very light and quite complex. The aromas of roasted peaches and apricots is lovely but low in intensity. The same can be said for the palate; complex and a touch dilute. The finish on this surprising, it has a real persistence to it.",84,10,Piedmont
39890,US,"A good rosé, fruity and spicy and crisp in acids. It's a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise offers pleasant flavors of strawberries, raspberries, herb tea and spices.",87,18,California
39900,US,"The tech sheet for this wine nicely mentions how the vineyard is surrounded by both 100-year-old walnut trees and, what do you know?, marijuana. Does either influence the wine? It does show a muskiness but really its strengths are steely drops of extreme lemon, most decidedly on the long, exuberant finish.",87,15,California
39910,France,"Already lightening in color and possessing only modest cherry fruit, this supple wine should be consumed over the next few months.",84,13,Rh?ne Valley
39920,US,"Too heavy for a rosé, with black cherry, cola and leather flavors that lack the delicacy and zest you want in a blush wine.",84,23,California
39930,US,"Very soft and simple, with candied flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and oak. Perfectly fine for drinking now.",84,24,California
39940,US,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.",82,13,California
39950,US,"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel.",82,14,New York
39960,US,"Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only.",80,18,New York

40040,Italy,"Here's an elegant, drying Prosecco Brut (with 10% Bianchetta and 5% Verdiso) that delivers pretty mineral linearity backed by a beautiful embroidery of flowers and yellow fruit. The wine is clean and crisp with zesty lemon on the close.",87,,Veneto
40050,Spain,"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas. The palate is round and solidly formed, with creamsicle flavors and a bit of brown sugar or treacle. A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.",87,9,Northern Spain
40060,US,"This bottling by fine producer Kunde always shows a grassy, hay-like note to the citrus fruit flavors, so if that's your style, you'll like it. The wine itself is only lightly oaked, and feels crisp and clean in the mouth, as well as dry. The low alcohol is a pleasure.",87,15,California
40070,Austria,"Very fresh, crisp fruit, light and with a soft, green plum skin texture. The aftertaste is lively, bright.",87,15,Nieder?sterreich
40080,Portugal,"Produced from organic grapes grown in the dry C?a valley, this is a pure, fruited wine with a black-plum-skin texture and firm tannins. With its layers of acidity, it is crisp at the end while remaining solidly textured. The wine needs to age further, drink from 2018.",90,20,Douro

41480,US,"Super aromatic, with apricot, orange marmalade and honey aromas. The wine is not as sweet as you expect, with residual sugar of 4%. It's also terrifically acidic. This creates imbalance. It's too tart for the sweetness or, conversely, not sweet enough. —S.H.",87,12,California

41560,France,"Ripe berry aromas set the scene for this balanced, juicy wine. Full of black currant and berry flavors, it's already delicious with its fruitiness. The tannins, though, need to calm down somewhat, and the wine will be better from 2019.",88,24,Bordeaux

41600,France,"Dark and intense, with notes of roasted meat, plum and black olive that give way to an espresso note and chalky tannins on the finish. Pretty stern stuff, which just means you'll want to give it another year or two before drinking it over the next 5?? years.",88,15,Rh?ne Valley

41620,France,"It takes a while to get beyond the dry structure of this wine.

41670,New Zealand,"Saint Clair's main Sauvignon Blanc bottling came out really well in 2013, balancing green leafy notes with grapefruit elements.

41710,US,"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used.

41730,US,"Lemon-lime soda scents are rounded out by pineapple and a metallic element on the nose of this wine by Christian Roguenant. It's tight and minerally on the palate, with steel and gunmetal, yet shows green herbs like dill too. It will work well with white fish.",88,17,California
41740,Italy,"Aromas of leafy underbrush, toast and menthol lead the nose. On the palate, notes of licorice and grilled herb accent the core of dried red berry. Assertive tannins provide the backbone but still need to unwind. Drink after 2018.",88,48,Tuscany
41750,France,"With a nutty flavor fresh apples and pears and a touch of honey, this is a delicious wine. It is full of ripe fruit that has not lost its crisp, cool character.

41780,US,"Bold and nicely astringent, this wine is full bodied, rich in flavor and even richer in texture due to a thick layer of fine tannins. Built almost like a Cabernet but with brighter fruit flavors, the wine is attractively dry and meant to be enjoyed with something rich like a roast or steak.",89,32,California

41810,Spain,"At first this smells raw and oaky, so much so that notes of paint and paste are as prominent as vanilla. In the mouth, however, this is a fresh wine with tomatoey acidity. Flavors of baked berry, plum and raisin blend with herbal notes, while the finish is long and tastes of vanilla and spice.",88,21,Northern Spain
41820,France,"This surprisingly dry wine has more to do with spice than richness. That gives it a food friendly character full of ripe fruit, a spicy, peppery edge and baked apple flavors. Acidity cuts through providing balance. Drink from the end of 2015.",88,26,Alsace
41830,Italy,"Crushed berry, blue flower and savory herb aromas open this wine. The linear palate doles out sour cherry, star anise, mineral and grilled sage. Enjoy soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.",88,22,Sicily & Sardinia
41840,US,"This is not only one of the best Syrahs of the vintage, it's easily the greatest Syrah ever produced from Sonoma Valley. Stuns with its soft,  complex, black and blue berry, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The depth is unbelievable, the length impressive. Clearly a first growth Syrah, and should develop bottle complexity for the next six years, if not longer.",97,90,California
41850,US,"Shows the elegance and pedigree that this estate vineyard, in the heart of the Oakville bench, always shows. The tannins are sweet and ripe, and the wine brims with luscious blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors, accented with new oak that's flashy, yet perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Should slowly mature over the years.",95,120,California
41860,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir that shows how well the variety does in these mountains, and it's sad that vineyard acreage is so low due to housing development. The wine is dry, silky and vastly interesting in cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Compelling and complex now, it should age over the next six years.",94,70,California

In the finish you pick up an elegant streak of green tea.",91,35,Oregon

42040,Chile,"Dark, muscular and concentrated, with char, rubber and blackberry aromas. Thick but not soupy, with big tannins and firm acids.

42130,Chile,"Hardly in the same class as the more elevated Pargua, this second wine is roasted and murky, and frankly a little dirty. It's as if the ripe, healthy fruit went to the $40 Pargua I and the raisiny, heavy stuff to this. Hence, it's candied, baked, syrupy and hot.",83,20,Maipo Valley

42150,US,"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core.

42190,Spain,"Color doesn't always mean a lot, but in this case a burnished gold-meets-tan color indicates that this is tired and fading. Aromas of commercial apple juice are sweet but bland.

42260,Chile,"Yellow tinted, which announces that this wine was barrel aged. And that barrel character is huge on the nose, which smells of raw oak, vanilla and dried cheese. Feels creamy, but the acidity is lively as well. Shows flashes of brilliance but also fights to absorb all the wood that's been thrown at it.

42360,France,"The wine is rounded and soft with attractive berry fruits and wood aging. It's fruity with juicy acidity, black currant freshness and a dry core that will allow it to age 2017??018.",84,13,Bordeaux
42370,France,"A late Merlot harvest (October 19) from 22 acres, the wine was stored for 12??6 months in cement vats. Dry and extracted with a hard edge that dulls the fruit, the wine will likely stay that way.",83,,Bordeaux
42380,France,"The over-exuberance of wood aging spoils this wine. With strong spice and equally tannic elements, it's all about the skeleton and not about the flesh of the fruit.",83,10,Bordeaux
42390,US,"Soft yet tannic, this has a brooding quality that suggests it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It shows elaborate flavors of blackberries, plums and cola, with earthy notes of mushrooms and mulch. Good now, after decanting, and should gradually evolve in the bottle over the next 6?? years.",93,75,California
42400,US,"This is currently very dry and austere due to its tannins, but it's impressive for its noble structure and deep, complex flavors of blackberries, cranberries, brown sugar and spices.- With such depth and a long finish, it's clearly a cellar candidate. Don't even think about opening it until 2017, at least.",93,65,California
42410,US,"Big, deep and hard in tannins, this wine shows the estate's power and concentration, bearing blasts of cherries, currants, persimmons and cola. The flavors are pinpointed with laserlike focus, with hints of cocoa powder and tamari. It should begin to open by 2017, and develop for many years afterward.",93,82,California
42420,US,"The oak, a mixture of French, American and Hungarian (with 50% new), takes the lead, with aromas of vanilla bean and toffee out in front of coffee and plum. The flavors are full bodied, sweet and generous, backed by grainy tannins.",88,30,Washington
42430,US,"The wood and alcohol seem to get out front of aromas of plum, raspberry and medicine cabinet. Flavors are sweet and concentrated with a tart, cranberry-filled finish. A lot of good things are going on but they don't quite seem to all come together.",88,50,Washington
42440,New Zealand,"Like most 2012 Marlborough Pinots, this is crisp, with pie cherry fruit leading the way. Hints of campfire and button mushrooms add welcome complexity, ending on a long, mouthwatering note of tart fruit.",88,40,Marlborough
42450,US,"This is a lean Dominus, showing the difficulties of the vintage. It's dry and tannic, with black currant, cherry and cassis flavors that are wrapped in strong, hard tannins. It's a good wine, but lacks the r ich complexity you expect from this property.",88,179,California
42460,US,"An elegant Syrah abundant in floral aromatics, demure in forward black and red fruit and a tinge of lavender. On the finish is pepper, the appropriate accent for a tastefully peppery meal.",88,28,California
42470,Portugal,"This big, ripe wine is well polished with a juicy, fragrant character from the spiced plums. The wood aging has resulted in deceptively soft tannins, and the delicious black fruits are still upfront. This wine could age for 2?? years.",89,15,Alentejano
42480,Portugal,"Almost cool in character, this crisp Douro comes from high-altitude vineyards. The grapes yield a fruity citrus- and pear-driven wine that's minerally, with just the right amount of acidity to push its freshness forward.",89,9,Douro
42490,Argentina,"The nose on this Malbec is blue-green, meaning it deals both blueberry and boysenberry but also alfalfa and minty green aromas. The palate feels big and generous, with nice acidity and flavors of pastry, jammy blackberry, molasses and spice. Amid the layered finish, you'll find baked black-fruit flavors and light green notes.",89,80,Mendoza Province
42500,France,"A lightly perfumed wine, this is soft with warm strawberry flavors. The acidity and texture play a supporting role in this ripe, light-bodied wine.",85,17,Burgundy
42510,Italy,"Made with organically-farmed Glera grapes, this sparkling Prosecco Superiore opens with subtle tones of lemon or almond blossom with slightly more sweetness than you usually get with a Brut sparkler.",85,13,Veneto
42520,Italy,"You can't beat the price versus quality ratio on offer here. Yes, this is an easy and thin wine, but it also delivers just enough fruit freshness and personality to pair with easy vegetable dishes or salads. Great for pool side parties or barbecues.",85,10,Veneto
42530,US,"Shows the impeccable viticulture and winemaking talent that mark all of Jarvis's red wines. The tannins and acidity are considerable, giving the cherry flavor such a nice bite. A lovely wine to drink now with steak or Italian-inspired beef dishes.",90,70,California

42550,US,"You can call this blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache a Rh?ne blend, but it's like nothing that ever came from France. Distinctly Californian in softness and ripeness, it has jammy, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate.",84,30,California
42560,Chile,"Clean but neutral, with decent lift, zest and body. The flavors run sweet to tropical, with pithy notes and a hint of green vegetables on the finish. Very basic and worthwhile, but regular in every sense of the word.",84,10,Maule Valley

42610,Italy,"Aromas of leather, scorched earth, mature plum and a whiff of mocha lead the way. The forward palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, grilled herb and a hint of tobacco accompanied by polished tannins. It shows the heat of the vintage so drink sooner rather than later.",89,30,Tuscany
42620,US,"Grass, gooseberry and grapefruit wind their way around a light-bodied, crisp and ephemeral wine, aged mostly in stainless steel, with a small percentage in neutral French oak.

42630,France,"With some wood aging, this limited-production wine comes from 45-year-old vines. It balances the lightly spicy wood flavors with crisp citrus fruits. The wine is still young, still fully integrating and will be much better from 2017.",89,25,Loire Valley

42660,Spain,"A maderized tint and baked, raisiny flavors make for a rich but flat bouquet. Following suit, this feels heavy, with fig-like richness and choppy tannins. Flavors of raisin, vanilla, coconut and stewed berry fruits end chunky, with spice, vanilla and saucy notes.",87,48,Northern Spain
42670,Italy,"The nose is rather closed but eventually reveals aromas of espresso, toasted oak, clove and a balsamic note. The tightly wound palate offers unripe cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage while firm, grainy tannins leave an astringent finish.",87,46,Tuscany

42770,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot doesn't seem to have fully ripened with prominent herbal notes that lean into the green, along with green olive and saline. It tastes quite sweet, giving the perception of lingering residual sugar.",82,14,Idaho
42780,US,"Offering pronounced aromas of apricot fuzz, this is a pungent, slightly flabby white with a layer of unbalanced sweetness on the midpalate that lingers a long time.",82,15,California
42790,Argentina,"This red-tinted, full-bodied rosé is strained on the nose, with a strong, distinct whiff of wet animal fur. The palate feels heavy and unfocused, while flavors of plum skins and nectarine finish bitter and without any crispness or cleansing properties.",82,15,Mendoza Province
42800,Italy,"Underbrush, grilled porcini mushroom, leather and a whiff of iris lead the nose. On the youthfully assertive palate, clove, star anise, orange peel and aromatic herb accent tart red cherry while firm tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone.",90,80,Piedmont
42810,Italy,"Leafy underbrush, leather, truffle, grilled herb and tilled soil aromas lead the way. The dense, forward palate doles out juicy black cherry, star anise, tobacco and an earthy hint of game while velvety tannins give it a smooth, polished texture.

42830,US,"Dry and crisp in coastal acidity, this Pinot Noir shows the full-bodied sturdiness reflecting its appellation, in the foothills above the Salinas Valley. It's quite rich in berry, cherry, cola and spice flavors, with firm tannins. Give it a few months in the bottle to calm down.",89,62,California
42840,US,"Consistent with past vintages, this still-young wine has a yeasty nose, textural mouthfeel and light pear fruit flavors, gently dappled with cinnamon spice. There is just a hint of sweatiness in the finish.",89,16,Oregon
42850,Italy,"A pretty blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, it begins with aromas of bright red berries and blue flower. The soft, friendly palate offers red cherry and hints of cooking spices in an easy, ready-to-enjoy style. The Marchetti Company, Imports Inc., Pio Imports.",87,17,Tuscany
42860,US,"A mouth-filling red that's dry and chewy in tannins, with a dark berry core surrounded by roasted herbs and earth. Lush on the palate it's in balance and well-made, from a relatively cool growing region near the Sacramento Delta.",87,25,California
42870,US,"With alcohol under 13%, this spicy, well-constructed Pinot Gris is decidedly cut in a European mold. Grapefruit and fiddlehead fern flavors combine, with surprising concentration and length. For food matches think along the lines of what goes best with a spicy, grassy Sauvignon Blanc.",89,17,Oregon
42880,Italy,"This is a genuine and straightforward red wine from Piedmont that would pair with oven-roasted pasta or meat loaf. The wine (made from Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina) is lean and fresh in the mouth, but ends with a very focused blast of almond and marzipan like flavors.",89,52,Piedmont
42890,US,"This barrel selection actually was given less exposure to new French oak than the estate bottling, a telling fact, which demonstrates Anam Cara's commitment to fruit and terroir. Elegant and charming, it links pomegranate, raspberry and cherry fruit to silky tannins, achieving a lovely purity of expression in a year of moderate ripeness.",89,45,Oregon
42900,Argentina,"Low intensity red fruit aromas are better than the sour orange peel and stemmy bramble that mar the wine's nose and core flavors. Tart, tight red wine with a narrow mouthfeel, tannic grab and rhubarb on the finish.",81,10,Mendoza Province
42910,US,"Simple, soft and dull, with vegetal aromas and flavors that barely suggest cherries.",80,8,California
42920,US,"A voluptuous wine that shows its sunny California origins in the ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It's delicious on a purely hedonistic level, showing the dynamism of a Highlands Pinot Noir, even if it lacks some structural subtlety and dryness.",88,55,California
42930,Spain,"Stalky and grassy smelling, which is par for a Penedès white blend. There str also apple and lemon-lime notes on the nose. In the mouth, it's lively and spritzy in feel, with pineapple, lime and grassy flavors. Zesty, dry and minerally on the finish, this should pair well with seafood and paella.",87,15,Catalonia
42940,Spain,"Citrusy on the nose, with rooty, restrained, earthy accents. It feels full but a bit dull in the middle, with flavors of minty spice, pepper and mature red fruit. Dry and drawing on the finish, with a tomatoey flavor.",87,15,Levante
42950,Italy,"There's more structure and power here with aromas that recall yellow flowers, pear and melon. In the mouth, the wine has delicate mineral tones and piquant freshness on the finish that leaves a fresh, spicy impression.",87,18,Southern Italy
42960,US,"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon.",87,35,California
42970,Spain,"The nose seems a touch reduced and nutty, but airing unveils sweet blackberry aromas and then candied, creamy berry fruit flavors. There isn't quite the body and structure that 125 has the potential to deliver, but it's still solid, well oaked and moderately tannic.",87,47,Northern Spain
42980,US,"An estate wine from an elevated elevation, this opens in fragrant red cherry and vanilla, with a subtle trace of brambly blackberry. Soft, it features a supple mouthfeel, medium weight and a backbone of structure, earthy and enticing. Easily enjoyable now, it should take on added complexity through 2022.",93,125,California
42990,Italy,"Made entirely with Merlot, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of ripe berry, coffee, vanilla, exotic spice and a whiff of grilled herb. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries, juicy raspberries licorice, chocolate and tobacco, while velvety tannins provide the framework. A note of dried sage closes the finish. It's already approachable but will continue to age well for several years or more. Drink through 2023.",93,300,Tuscany
43000,Germany,"Swathes of fresh green herbs and florals refresh tart yellow plum and peach notes in this racy, light-footed Riesling. Juicy stone fruit flavors are accented with long streaks of wax and lanolin that lend density and viscosity to the long, long finish. Gorgeous now, but likely to improve through 2025,",93,42,Mosel
43010,US,This powerful wine is sourced from 100-year-old vines in the famous Deaver vineyard. There's a touch of pepper behind the thick tannins and oak. It's a long lasting wine with leathery blackberry fruit that should come to the fore over time.,88,30,California
43020,Italy,"Aromas of wildflower, orchard fruit and hazelnut open on the nose. The lively, linear palate shows crunchy green pear, bitter almond and a hint of nutmeg alongside racy acidity.",87,17,Northeastern Italy

43050,France,"Full bodied, flamboyant and opulent, this is a ripe, exotic rendering of 100% Marsanne. Honey, apricot and mandarin orange notes ease slowly over the palate, finishing with a lush richness that suggests drinking over the near term.",90,36,Rh?ne Valley
43060,US,"On its own, this Mourvèdre-based Rh?ne-style blend is fairly straightforward. It has candied aromas and tastes, suggesting raspberry-flavored licorice and cola. However, it is dry and crisp in acidity, balanced overall. It will be a fine companion to a wide range of fare.",90,55,California
43070,France,"This wine features bright red fruits, with attractive tannins and a gentle, ripe character. It's dense, while not at all powerful, fruity or very forward. Keep for 4?? years.",89,,Bordeaux

43090,Italy,"The attraction here is the beautiful packaging. Embedded with sparkling crystals that spell Bottega, this showcase wine will appeal to a young crowd. The sparkler is Pinot Noir, made as a white wine, with a floral bouquet and a lean mouthfeel.",85,,Veneto
43100,US,"Striking acidity adds freshness to more rustic characteristics of cooked red fruit, caramelized sugar and hay on this medium-bodied Pinot. Brambly on the palate with hints of mushroom and foliage, it finishes clean with just a trace of tannins.",84,26,New York
43110,US,"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.",86,45,Oregon
43120,US,"A promising Grenache. Shows tremendous cherry flavors wrapped into elegantly smooth tannins, and the finish is dry and spicy. Pretty good, but a little fruit-driven and one-dimensional. The next step is to build in extra layers of complexity and depth.",87,60,California
43130,Italy,"Solalto is a pretty dessert wine with a dark amber color and simple aromas of toasted almond, apricot honey, pine nut and maple syrup. The texture is thick and gritty in places and the wine delivers genuine and easygoing appeal.",87,55,Tuscany
43140,France,"There is rich fruit behind the severe opening tannins, giving a sumptuous although firmly structured wine. The raspberry and crushed strawberry flavors are developing well, ready to balance with the tannins after another year.",93,,Burgundy
43150,Italy,"The Ravera cru is celebrated for its power and elegance and this beautiful Barolo definitely delivers both. The wine shows beautifully linear aromas of red fruit, blue flower, smoke and exotic spice backed by bright intensity and firm tannins.",93,65,Piedmont
43160,US,"This meaty, gamy wine is 84% Mourvèdre, and marries its earthy flavors to the ripe black fruit of the Syrah. The two mix well, but could use a bit more bottle time to fully integrate. Blood, meat, cassis, and smoke mingle, and some heat slips in at the end, along with rich coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Big, flavorful, lingering.",93,45,Washington
43170,US,"This is a nicely sour, flinty and balanced full-bodied wine from a cool-climate site. Despite its roundness and warmth, this finds a way to be light and lean in between the luxuriousness and generous nature of the vintage and style.",90,52,California
43180,Portugal,"This is a beautifully perfumed, lightly wood-aged wine. With grapes from the Douro Superior, it is rich while remaining impressively fresh. There are apricot and ripe pear flavors that are given a smoky, toasty edge by the wood aging. It is ready to drink.",90,28,Douro
43190,Australia,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is more restrained than the 2013, but still offers plenty of roasted-cashew toastiness combined with hints of pineapple and guava. The finish is clean and refreshing, but doesn't show the hoped-for length, so drink this over the near term.",90,200,Western Australia
43200,US,"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade.",93,55,California
43210,US,"Kudos to Azalea Springs for bottling this with a screwtop. The vineyard is between St. Helena and Calistoga, at the foot of Diamond Mountain. It has mountain-sized tannins, making it astringently hard. It also has a solid core of blackberry and black currant fruit. This is not one of your soft, gentle cult Cabs, it's one that demands cellaring. Best 2010??014.",92,75,California
43220,Portugal,"Wood-aged and almost black in color from the ripe, sweet berry fruit flavors and the velvet, opulent layers of polished wood and tannins. It's certainly a powerhouse of flavors, but the dry core keeps it from being out of balance, while the aftertaste is sweet and dry at the same time. Impressive.",92,25,Douro
43230,US,"This is a light-bodied, very fruity and soft-textured wine that smells like cherries, berries and melons and tastes fresh and a touch sweet. The acidity is low and the bubbles are lively, so it's easy to sip.",87,20,California

43270,Chile,"Raw, earthy plum aromas are spicy and lightly herbal. This feels saucy yet monotone. Tomato, red-plum and herbal flavors end with a hint of brown sugar and a continuation of the wine's herbal plum character.",85,10,Maule Valley
43280,US,"Medium-pink in color, apple and berry aromas are followed by spritzy, moderately sweet fruit flavors. It goes down easy.",85,10,Washington
43290,US,"A bit rustic and rough around the edges, but for the price, not bad. Fruity and spicy, it's the kind of wine you drink with pizza, lasagna, barbecue or just bacon rinds, and who cares if it's not subtle.",84,12,California
43300,US,"Ripe in green apple, banana and pineapple, this is a heavily barrel-influenced wine, intense in petroleum and toasty vanilla. Save this for buttery lobster or risotto dishes.",84,16,California

43360,France,"The moated fairy-tale castle of Agassac is a showpiece of the Médoc. This wine is structured, juicy and firm. It has dense dry tannins at this stage although the weight of fruit shows it will develop richly. The wine, with its hints of a blackberry future, will be ready to drink from 2020.",91,35,Bordeaux
43370,France,"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin. The characteristic 2014 freshness makes this bright and sprightly and creates an off-dry finish to the concentrated palate.",91,35,Alsace
43380,Australia,"Simple, sweet-tasting and slightly candied, this bouncy drink is best served slightly chilled. Think of it as an introduction to wine—something to explore after white Zinfandel. —J.C.",83,9,Australia Other
43390,Australia,"If there's nothing special to recommend here, there's also nothing awry. Leather and earth join modest tart berry flavors. Finishes dry and tough; it's an austere wine that probably needs food to come alive. —J.C.",83,20,Victoria
43420,France,"Scented impressions of ripe pear and aloe vera pervade this wine. The palate shows texture and more fruit than you might expect from slender Sylvaner. The finish is brisk, clean and taut.",89,13,Alsace

43440,Canada,"This wine still appears to be coming out of its shell, showing some reduction with reticent notes of red plum, cherry and berry. The flavors are lipsmacking and rich, but it's difficult right now to get a clear sense of where it's all going.",87,40,British Columbia
43450,Portugal,"There is a solid, tannic core in this Baga-dominant blend. It gives a smoke and blackcurrent flavored wine, with a firm layer of dry tannins and intense acidity. The wine is well structured, but needs time to age. Drink after 2016.",87,12,Bairrada
43460,US,"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort.",90,50,Oregon

43500,US,"Dried black cherries, cola, root beer, black rocks and a hint of tarragon swirl into a lovely nose on this rarely used varietal. The palate offers clean blackberry and plum juice, with a minty lift reminiscent of camphor and eucalyptus.",90,33,California
43510,US,"The dark raspberry, plum, herb, vanilla and spice aromas and flavors are rich and high octane. It's not for the faint of heart but offers plenty of appeal.",90,24,Washington
43520,France,"This wine is so light, it is almost insubstantial. Hints of white fruit float across the surface, backed up by acidity and a gentle, fresh character. It is ready to drink.",84,30,Burgundy
43530,US,"The aromas of almond and spice are quite light and elusive on this wine, while the sweet fruit flavors seem dilute.",84,24,Washington
43540,Argentina,"This is a rough, leathery and stalky Cabernet. Horseradish and leather aromas set up a lightly green, herbal and peppery flavor profile. While the wine feels pretty good, there's no escaping its green-leaning, stalky character.",84,34,Mendoza Province
43550,France,"Light and bright, this fruity wine has a more bitter element that gives a sharper character that will hopefully round out. At the back, plenty of acidity leaves a crisp aftertaste.",84,25,Burgundy
43560,Argentina,"Peach and flower aromas are pleasant and light. This is also delicate and airy across the palate, while sweet, candied flavors of lychee, apple and green melon finish sweet, on the verge of cloying. 80% Chenin Blanc with 10% each Moscato and Torrontés.",84,15,Mendoza Province
43570,Argentina,"Rough cherry and plum aromas are indicative of what's to come. This feels fresh but raw, with high acidity and not much body or depth. Tart plum and cranberry flavors finish with sharp acidity and a drawing sensation.",84,9,Mendoza Province
43580,France,"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly.",89,18,Bordeaux
43590,US,"Completing a quartet of excellent white-wine releases from Mercer, this lively, balanced Chardonnay comes on steely. It's clean and textural, with a mix of citrus flesh and rind, apple and melon. There is even a hint of lemon cream, keeping the finish light and refreshing.",89,15,Washington
43600,Italy,"Linear, silky and long, this has ethereal tones of cola, licorice and dried mint. There's also a pretty mineral component of brimstone and talcum powder that gives the palate a dry feel.",89,,Piedmont
43610,Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas are hanging in, while this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Torrontés feels drawn in. Slightly salty melon and apple flavors are showing a hint of oxidation. This finishes a bit dried out.",84,13,Mendoza Province
43620,France,"This wine is tight and tannic, firm and missing fruit. It seems to have been heavily extracted, giving a bitter character to the wine. It could soften, although that is difficult to imagine.",84,30,Burgundy
43630,Argentina,"Flat aromas barely press Torrontés's standard tropical fruit button. Plump, easygoing and soft on the palate, this tastes lightly of passion fruit and lychee, while a mild banana and melon character drives the finish.",84,14,Other
43640,US,"Complex, classy winemaking is evident from the first sniff to the final sip. Savory notes of green tea and clean earth complement a terroir-driven wine. The notes and nuances pile on—flowers and fruits, cherry and cassis, with a whiff of barnyard and undergrowth. The lingering, expressive finish is already boggling, and seems sure to continue to evolve gracefully through 2025??030.",95,100,Oregon
43650,Germany,"Perfumed florals mingle curiously with deep, dusty mineral notes on this bracing TBA. Sunny nectarine and tangerine flavors are mouthwatering and juicy, struck with acidity, then plunged into pools of sweet honey and nectar. It's a delightful sensory roller coaster that feels endless on the finish.",95,775,Rheingau
43660,Spain,"This deep, smoky, minerally wonder is full to the brim with ripe blackberry, tobacco and fine-oak aromas. In the mouth, this Tempranillo-led blend is rich and jammy but not out of shape. Blackberry, prune and toasty flavors finish lusty, with a touch of heat and burn that should settle in due time. Drink now through 2023.",94,75,Northern Spain
43670,France,"While the wine is really pale in color, it does have a great range of flavors, offering red fruit notes balanced by beautiful acidity and citrus streaks. It's gently textured, giving a good bite to the fruitiness at the end.",91,,Provence
43680,France,"Meant by the producer to be drunk all year (Quat'Saisons means four seasons), this ripe and rounded wine will go as well with a light summer lunch as with turkey at Thanksgiving. The fruit shows gently, warmly and with just the right amount of fresh acidity.",91,23,Provence
43690,Austria,"Ripe, rounded green pear flavors gain edge from peppery, herbal notes and the verve of zesty lemon acidity. The conference pear flavors shine through to the very end to provide zesty, savory pleasure.",91,28,Kremstal
43700,US,"A beautiful Cabernet, dry and rich, with wonderful tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweet, an apparent contradiction the palate loves. Shows near perfect ripeness, an impressive range of blackberries, plums and cassis, and an earthy herbaceousness. May be a little too young for proper enjoyment, so give it a few years in the cellar.",93,45,California
43710,US,"So softly delicious, it's probably not an ager, but what a terrific wine to drink now and over the next few years. Really luscious, showing modern-style ripe blackberry, black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors that sink deep and last long into the finish. The tannins and overall structure lift it into classy elegance.",93,100,California
43720,Argentina,"Baked plum and berry aromas are lusty and jammy. In the mouth, this is tannic and the acidity is citric in character. Flavorwise, A Lisa is pumping out brawny berry flavors matched by lemony oak notes, and the finish is expansive, with blanketing tannic grip. This will show best in late 2014, after it's had more time to settle.",88,22,Other
43730,France,"This medium-bodied wine combines grilled cherries with meaty, savory notes. It's not the biggest, baddest or boldest, but it is nicely harmonious and fruit-forward, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next year or two.",88,15,Rh?ne Valley
43740,Italy,Here's a round and approachable Aglianico that shows a softer side to what is southern Italy's most noble grape. This offers delicious blackberry flavors layered with nutmeg and a hint of vanilla along with smooth tannins.,88,15,Southern Italy
43750,Spain,"This barrel-fermented Viura is crystalline on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas, minerally apple notes and a touch of yeast. Balanced and properly acidic, this tastes like nectarine, lemon and persimmon, while the finish is balanced, zesty and a touch oily in texture.",88,16,Northern Spain
43760,France,"The nonvintage Taittinger cuvée, with its lively mousse, is soft and creamily fruity. While the bottle tasted was young, it had enough ripe white fruits and lime-juice flavors to balance out the freshness. Typically for Taittinger, Chardonnay is an important element in the blend, giving the wine its final mineral tautness.",88,42,Champagne
43770,France,"Frothy, fresh, lemony and light—this uncomplicated, slightly earthy crémant is ideal apéritif material with its easy-drinking, light-footed character. There's a lemony lift on the finish that's rather moreish.",88,25,Alsace
43780,Argentina,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy. Surprisingly good given the paltry price and Argentina's dearth of success with Viognier.",87,8,Mendoza Province
43790,US,"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",87,21,California
43800,Italy,"Querceta delivers a beautiful Brunello with bold tones of ripe fruit, red cherry, spice, leather and vanilla bean. This bold red offers both structure and fresh acidity on the finish.",92,34,Tuscany
43810,US,"Girard's recent Petite Sirahs have been great, really defining a Napa approach to the variety, and their 2010 is right up there. It's fairly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of overripeness. You'll find delicious blackberry jam, black currant, grilled bacon and black pepper flavors that finish dry, spicy and above all, satisfying. Wonderful now, but it should easily negotiate the next 10 years in the bottle.",92,28,California
43820,Portugal,"The smooth oak aging is a major element in the success of this elegant wine. While it has rich, polished black fruits and a strong tannic core, it also has a licorice character. It is now maturing, ready to drink as a serious, complex wine.",92,,Alentejano
43830,Portugal,"This is a ripe, wood-aged wine that is rich with dark plum and ripe berry tones. Its big, bold character is primary and a far cry from subtle. Drink now.",85,10,Alentejano

43860,Italy,"It’s funny how a wine like this, so austere in both aroma and flavor, can be so appealing. For one thing, the acidity is enormously high, and really turns on the taste buds. What flavors there are tend toward limes and unripe peaches, but the real deal is mineral and herb. It really shines in cleanliness, zestiness and liveliness.",88,10,Central Italy
43870,France,"A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay from grand cru vineyards, this is a clean, precisely made wine that almost seems engineered—it's that crisply defined. It shows perfect, streaming, tiny bubbles, a tight, yeasty entry and a steely, concise finish.",88,40,Champagne
43880,US,"The aromas of powerful cedar, cherry, currant and oak suggest great concentration and focus. It’s actually a bit light on the fruit and soft in tannins, although the oak is plush and toasty. There’s certainly elegance and flavor, but it’s a wine to drink now, not age.",87,24,California
43890,US,"A very firm and well-structured expression of pure Walla Walla Syrah. There is a core of blueberry and blackberry fruit, amply wrapped in sweetly toasty, smoky oak (despite very little new barrel usage). It finishes clean with the characteristic earthy foundation of Walla Walla Syrah, and a streak of rock and licorice.",92,45,Washington
43900,Italy,"From the Serralunga d'Alba area of Barolo production (an area known for thicker, denser, more structured wines) comes this bold and beautiful expression of Nebbiolo. The wine boasts huge intensity and luscious, soft roundness on the close.",92,,Piedmont
43910,US,"Earthy with dusty loam and forest scents, this wine is intensely rich, with grippy, chewy tannins. Fine-grained oak notes support dark chocolate, clove and tobacco flavors, accented with fruit-forward elements that recall wild blueberry and blackberry. Structured to age, it will be best from 2023 through 2030.",93,150,California
43920,US,"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.",93,80,California
43930,Austria,"This wine's fresh, ripe red cherry and aromatic strawberry touches make for an inviting nose. The palate shows the same intense primary fruit, bolstered by freshness and a fine, filigreed structure. Its supple, pure fruit makes it very enjoyable now, but it's sure to evolve further with bottle age. Drink now??025.",93,19,Thermenregion
43940,Portugal,"A wine made in memory of Catherine (Caterina) of Bragan?a, a Portuguese princess who married Charles II of England in the 17th century. It is a superripe wine, full of tropical fruit flavors and only the lightest of acidity. Wood aging gives the wine a plush character and suggests it could age for another year. Drink from 2016.",88,10,Península de Setúbal
43950,France,"This structured wine also has already delicious red fruit flavors. The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now. Drink now, although the wine will certainly age.",88,50,Burgundy
43960,France,"A smoothly ripe wine, with swathes of cherry and black currant fruits balanced by lively acidity. The wine, with its richness and the tannic structure, could well age for 3-4 years, although its fruitiness makes it delicious now.",91,23,Beaujolais
43970,US,"This is the most expensive newly released Cherryblock ever, $20 more than the 2007. It's quite a plush wine, softly velvety and rich in cherry and oak flavors. Already throwing considerable sediment, it's on the glidepath to a long, useful life.",91,95,California
43980,US,"A smooth, powerful Cabernet, made solidly in the modern style of exceedingly ripe fruit wrapped into soft tannins and then given an application of sweet oak. Shows many of the same characteristics of Napa Cabs costing far more, which makes it a relative bargain.",91,25,California
43990,Israel,Light weight and somewhat sweet with flavors of gummy peach candy and tropical fruit juice. Short and simple; drink now.,81,15,Upper Galilee

44010,Italy,"The term “extra dry??refers to the slightly soft sensations of sweetness and roundness on display here. That plush softness provides an excellent platform for the wine's aromas of white flower, peach and honey.",87,22,Veneto
44020,Italy,"In a nod to the most heartfelt of Veneto wine traditions, the bottle is closed with white string that holds the cork in place. Once open, the bottle boasts bright perfumes of peach blossom, honey and citrus.",87,22,Veneto
44030,Portugal,"Rounded and soft, this is a red-fruited wine. There is a strong element of spicy wood lending dryness and a cinnamon note, which goes well with the young, bright fruits and acids.",87,20,Setubal
44040,US,"From northeast-facing vineyards that catch morning sun at 1,200 feet, this is micro-terroir grapegrowing at its most extreme. Cool weather has yielded crisp acidity and fruit that runs the razor's edge between raspberry ripeness and mint-and-tomato earthiness. Very fine barrels add smoke, spice, vanilla and oak-modulated roundness. It seems to lack depth, but then so do certain Burgundies in their youth. —S.H.",89,38,California
44050,US,"This is classic juice, hard and packed with power, showing dark fruits laced with mocha and spice. The chalky tannins are the only quibble, but this wine will improve for at least a decade in your cellar. —P.G.",88,15,Washington
44060,Australia,"Rich and intense but also round and soft. A horsey note adds complexity and rusticity to the dark chocolate, leather and black cherry aromas and flavors. —J.C.",88,18,South Australia

44090,Chile,"Creamy in the nose, with a hint of vanilla and Bartlett pear. The palate isn't boring; there's cantaloupe and nutmeg nuances along with some papaya and banana. The weakness: The wine turns soft almost immediately upon pouring.",84,10,Maipo Valley
44100,Greece,"A pleasant, lemon-and-lime white, best with light fish dishes. Unlike most of its brethren, which are ready to go from the moment they're opened, this one has some burnt-matchstick aromas that need time and aeration to dissipate. Try decanting.",84,12,Naoussa
44110,Chile,"Rough at first, with leathery aromas and hints of bitter chocolate. Which all goes to say: Where's the snappy cherry fruit? It just doesn't seem to be here. What you do get is light raspberry and tea notes, and then some oak and herbal character on the finish.",84,12,Maipo Valley
44120,Portugal,"This is a beautifully ripe, smooth wine. The wood aging adds a touch of vanilla to what is rich blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Touriga Nacional. Black berry fruits, rich tannins and just the right amount of acidity make a wine that will be ready to drink in the medium-term. Drink from 2016.",90,16,Alentejano
44130,France,"A dark and brooding wine, it's very much a Malbec that needs to age. Solid tannins, berry fruits and concentrated structure all promise a serious wine that needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.",90,44,Southwest France
44140,Portugal,"Grande in all senses, this wine comes in a powerfully heavy bottle. The wine itself is very structured with ripe and dense tannins and concentrated black, juicy fruits. It comes from selected parcels in Rocim, and is only made in top years. Age this powerful wine and drink from 2017.",90,,Alentejo
44150,France,"You need to think ahead here, because this wine is currently totally dominated by wood. The richness and classic, balanced structure that is normal with Haut-Bailly seems to have been put aside in favor of a highly polished, toast-laden style. Search for the fruit and there is blackberry,spice and fruit tannin. But it's hard. Wait 10 years at least.",92,,Bordeaux
44160,France,"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4?? years.",92,135,Bordeaux
44170,US,"This is the first release from Cadence's estate vineyard, a 94/6 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Sharp and intense, the nose brings out tightly wound red fruit scents, annotated with leaf and white pepper. In this inaugural vintage the Cabernet Sauvignon clearly dominates.

44200,New Zealand,"In contrast to Giesen's Waihopai bottling, this shows much more decay. Mushrooms, dead leaves and a subdued earthiness anchor the wine's other notes of black cherry and cola. It's supple and medium-bodied, yet lacks a bit a length. Drink now.",87,90,Marlborough

The harmony of flavors and structure lingers onto the lengthy finish.",93,45,Languedoc-Roussillon
44240,Italy,"From Antinori's Castello della Sala estate, this landmark white helped to shine the spotlight on Umbria's untapped enological potential.

44250,Spain,"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry.

44310,Australia,"This oddball blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Chardonnay (both fermented in oak) and 25% Riesling (fermented in steel) actually works reasonably well. The nose is a blend of lime and peach, and despite the oak treatment, this medium-bodied wine is fruit driven, lithe and long.",88,25,South Australia
44320,US,"The winery's signature sparkler, this blend of equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with touches of Pinot Gris and Pinot Meunier, dazzles in rounded oak and a soft texture marked by grapefruit zest and fresh nectarine. Crisp and vibrant, it becomes richer on the finish, showing a spark of honey-baked brioche.",91,22,California
44330,US,"Paumanok's standard-label 2013 Merlot shares much of the same ripe ruddy fruit intensity of the Grand Vintage bottling. Lighter in body and a touch crisper on the palate, it's an elegant and nuanced yet more approachable wine. Taut with tannins and still tightly wound, it will still benefit from cellaring through 2022.",91,28,New York
44340,US,"This is one of the producer's deepest value propositions, a well-made, robustly approachable and accessible wine made from 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 7% Malbec, 3% Syrah, 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Soft and firmly integrated, it's perfumed and floral, with layers of dark cherry and tobacco that evolve with grace in the glass.",91,40,California

44400,France,"This is really mature Muscadet, yet it's certainly not too old. It is toasty, with almond, spice and vanilla flavors plus the concentration that comes from old vines.

44410,Italy,"Aromas suggesting resin, mature plum, forest floor, exotic spice, leather and black currant emerge on this solidly structured red. The firm palate offers espresso, raisin, cherry marinated in spirits, fig, licorice and chewing tobacco alongside firm, close-grained tannins that clutch the finish.",91,99,Veneto
44420,US,"This full-bodied wine offers a depth of brambly blackberry, smoky clove and cigar box that make it compelling and inviting on the velvety-smooth palate, well integrated in oak and tannin. The finish is a touch spicy, bringing out more of the clove and a shake of black pepper.",91,80,California

44460,US,"Tiers of aromas and flavors in this expressive wine reveal themselves like a Matryoshka doll. Wafts of dried apricot and chamomile open into tangerine peel and marmalade, then finally marzipan and ginger come forth on the nose. Concentrated flavors mimic the aromas and introduce fresh vanilla bean and hay. Racy acidity thrills, while two years in neutral French oak keeps the wine round and full-bodied. The finish is long and compelling.",89,35,Virginia
44470,Australia,"This wine starts shy but after some swirling reveals broody black cherry, raspberry, dark chocolate, Chinese Five Spice, and some medicinal notes in the background.

44590,US,"From the hillsides of Westside Road, a goldmine of goodness, this estate-driven wine is packed with cinnamon, black-cherry clafouti and crushed rose petals. Soft and seductively silky on the palate, it's bright and deceptively light, a symphony of pomegranate, cardamon and blood orange that lingers on the finish.",95,105,California
44600,US,"Made in tiny amounts, this wine blends 72% Mourvèdre with field-blended Petite Sirah, Syrah, Peloursin, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet. It comes from two acres in the heart of the appellation, representing historic varieties still hanging on for dear life. Raisiny leather, gunpowder and an intensity of blueberry give it life, atop an undeniable funkiness that's hard to resist.",94,45,California
44610,US,"A new project from Jackson Family Wines from the Boone Ridge Vineyard, this is a voluptuous Pinot delivers a substantial mouthfeel of dark blueberry fruit and mushroomy earth. Textured and grippy, its acidity is on the mark, a good go-to for family meals, especially a quiche Lorraine brimming with bacon.",88,40,California
44620,Portugal,"A ripe and creamy blend of Fern?o Pires and Arinto, this is both fresh and richly textured. It has weight as well as a smooth texture, full in the mouth while also tangy. Already delicious, it will also age, so drink until 2018.",88,11,Tejo
44630,Austria,"Deliciously ripe and juicy pear mingles with yellow plum and greengage on the nose. The palate, conversely, is held tight in a bright citrus corset featuring grapefruit, lemon and barely ripe tangerine: a layered mix of enticing, zesty flavors that refresh and scintillate. White pepper and some herbal spice just manage to edge in and will develop more fully with time. Clean, taut and very exciting.",94,55,Wachau
44640,France,"This wine has considerable potential, with rich tannins and firm fruits. It is solid, very dry at this stage although this is balanced by dark plum skin and blackberry flavors. The wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2022. The first harvest at this estate was in 1252. The property is now owned by Bernard Magrez, a wine, art, culture and gastronomy patron.",94,90,Bordeaux
44650,Austria,"Smoke and fruit, citrus peel and cream—what a seductive combination! This is subtly oaked Sauvignon Blanc of the finest order, from verdant Styria. The palate is taut but elastic, there is focus but also charm and whole oceans of gentle, tropical fruit with a fillip of lively citrus. It is hard not to drink this now but if you have patience, or even better, a whole case, do wait and this will flourish. Drink 2015??020.",94,60,Südoststeiermark
44660,US,"A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak. It offers well-defined flavors of salty leather, plum and dark chocolate.",91,52,California
44670,US,"A full 13-years-old, the aromas are all tertiary, bringing notes of mushroom, leather and dried cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are still holding on the palate, showing a delightful sense of balance. It's in a sweet spot. Drink now.",91,48,Washington
44680,France,"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century.

Drink from 2019.",91,15,Bordeaux
44690,US,"The future of Finger Lakes Sauvingnon Blanc is bright, at least in the hands of Steve Shaw. Fragrant with sweet, ripe gooseberries, apples and a touch of herbs and grass, this is a delicious choice for any occasion. Full bodied and complex, its palate is lush with quince and green plums, highlighted by a refreshing minerality and a lime zest astringency.",89,16,New York
44700,US,"A very rich Sauvignon Blanc that shows the creamy, smoky influence of oak barrels and lees. It's dry and soft, with flavors of citrus fruits, figs, buttered toast and white pepper.",89,24,California
44710,US,"A dainty nose of sliced pears, squeezed lemon and slowly emergent guava characterizes this sparkling wine, made in Santa Barbara from Northern California fruit. The bubbles are quite foamy, disappearing magically on the palate, but not before showing light acidity and a flash of guava.",88,30,California
44720,France,"While this wine certainly has a tannic background, it is already showing fruitiness and ripe berry and red plum flavors. That makes for a warm, rounded wine that will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2016.",88,80,Burgundy
44730,France,"This is tight, mineral and on the dry side of Brut. The 100% Chardonnay taste signals chalky soil—crisp and fresh. A pure line of acidity cuts through the texture, giving a balanced, always dry wine that could do with more bottle aging to soften the piercing acidity at the end.",88,70,Champagne
44740,Italy,"Here's a super-modern, piacione (roughly translated from the Italian as “no one can resist it?? wine with deep layers of vanilla, toast, roasted espresso bean, blackberry, balsam notes, smoke, spice and tar.

44760,France,"This is a crisp, high-wire-walking wine, just so poised. Its youthful red fruits, laced with citrus, taste so fresh, with a strawberry bite. At this stage, it is intensely enjoyable as young Champagne, but it does need to age for several years.",94,67,Champagne
44770,Spain,"Initial aromas of damp earth and coffee grounds are a bit misleading because this tastes almost entirely of ripe, slightly baked black fruits.

Drink from 2019??027.",93,120,Catalonia
44780,US,"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley.

It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up.",93,38,California
44790,US,"A perennial knockout, this wine continues to impress. The estate-grown grapes are picked specifically to make a bone-dry refreshing palate pleaser that's pretty in pink and orange tones.

44830,Italy,"Smoky cola and plum flavors feature some intriguingly briary notes, but also veer toward prune and cooked fruit. Tannins are soft, but the wine is surprisingly tart on the finish. With its crisp acidity, expect it to pair well with tomato-based sauces.",86,15,Southern Italy
44840,Portugal,"This blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is rustic with some hard tannins and intense acidity. Since it is still young, the wine could soften but it seems to be more about its structure than its fruit.",84,13,Lisboa
44860,France,"A light and bright wine, this offers plenty of herbal fruit that is lifted by crisp acidity. The wine is refreshing, lively and ready to drink.",84,15,Bordeaux
44870,France,"Pascal Sirat named this wine for his father and his son. Bright and fruity, it is already deliciously light, refreshing and bright. Acidity jumps out of the glass, giving a crisp, fresh character. The aftertaste is more taut and tense. Drink now.",86,15,Bordeaux
44880,Portugal,"The wine brings out a strongly herbal, tangy character in this perfumed grape. With spice and intense acidity, the wine is still young, still with a closed character. This needs to be drunk from late 2017 or even 2018.",86,14,Alentejano

44900,France,"This ripe and fruity wine has an edge of tannins to give it structure. It's full of juicy black fruits, rich berry flavors and fresh acidity. The wine will age as the tannins round out further, so drink from 2018.",86,22,Bordeaux
44910,France,"It's a shame that the producer used too much wood in this difficult vintage. The fruit is delicate, with the black-currant flavors and acidity smothered by a burnt, toasty character that's hard to taste through. It will soften, although the wood will always be there. Vignobles Roux bought this Cru Bourgeois in 2013. The blend is 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",85,,Bordeaux
44920,US,"Barrel aromas of vanilla and woodspice are out front and lead to light, elegant fruit and barrel flavors that vie for attention through the finish.",85,20,Washington
44930,France,"There is some good depth of flavor to this wine, the strawberry flavors going right through until they meet the tannic core. The acidity balances well, pushing the fruit through the dryness, leaving freshness and juicy fruits.",88,41,Burgundy
44940,Italy,"Sweet and fragrant, floral and fruity, this Prosecco Extra Dry (with 10% Pinot Bianco) has a feminine, creamy disposition and excellent harmony of aromas and effervescence.

44970,US,"A Grenache blended with small amounts of Mourvèdre and Syrah, this may need more time in bottle to truly reveal itself. But for now, its herbal characteristics overpower the hidden notes of blueberry and vanilla trying to get out.",85,25,California
44980,US,"With a smoked char aftertaste, this wine is lacking in fruit and fairly simple. A weediness could be interpreted as cedar or dried herb, but teeter-totters on the borderline.",82,9,California
44990,Spain,"The aroma is stalky and leathery on the nose. The palate is grabby, with sulfuric, bitter flavors of uncomplicated berry fruits. This is 65% Bobal and 35% Tempranillo.",80,9,Levante
45000,Portugal,"The intense combination of ripe, sweet fruit and amazing acidity that is Madeira is so evident in this wine. It has mature wood-aged acidity that cuts through the demerara sugar and smoky, toasty character, resulting in a wine that is totally memorable. Drink now.",96,220,Madeira
45010,Portugal,"Not one of the generally declared vintages for Port, this year produced some ripe, sweet single quinta vintages. It also was a good year for rich, sweet tawnies. This is ripe, toffee-like in character packed with ripe raisin and sultana flavors. It is a luxurious wine, of course ready to drink.",94,100,Port
45020,Spain,"Complex aromas of olive, dried leaves, kirsch and cassis set up a spunky, acid-rich palate that's integrated and well balanced.

45030,US,"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration. It retains its elegance, with scents of lavender, incense and Asian spices leading into bright, intense flavors of cherry and plum. The wine gathers itself in the midpalate, showing that fruit density, and finishes with a lick of chocolate. Drink 2018??030.",94,86,Oregon
45040,US,"From the start this has superb tannins and fine acidity that frame the ripe, complex blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors, finishing with elegance and class. It's hard to resist drinking now, but this should develop over the next eight years.",92,75,California
45050,US,"A blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Sémillon, this definitely reflects the cool 2011 vintage in its steely tension. The clean green-fruit flavors are well defined and highlighted with notes of grassy herbs and saline minerality.",91,23,Washington

45080,Italy,"This interesting wine boasts a spice-driven nose with aromas that recall nutmeg, clove and cardamom. But the nose is not limited to spice.

It also offers deep layers of cola, coffee and mineral and although the mouthfeel is chewy, there's enough silky softness to even it out.",90,60,Tuscany
45200,Chile,"Rubber and earth aromas lead to a mix of berry fruit scents and a pinch of vinegar. It's firm in the mouth, with cranberry and herbal raspberry flavors. Gives about as much as it can but at the same time it shows a tart, basic, mildly herbal DNA.",84,10,Maipo Valley

45280,US,"There's a beautiful wine in this Cabernet blend, which was grown at the foot of Howell Mountain. But it's not showing its best now.

Quite an intriguing combo.",93,56,California

45420,US,"This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay.

Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",88,19,Northern Spain
45690,France,"Clos Windsbuhl in Hunawihr is the northernmost of Zind-Humbrecht's collection of vineyards. In 2012, it has produced an impressive wine that has all the right spice of Pinot Gris along with acidity and a fresh edge.

45760,US,"Stumbles where Santa Barbara Cabs have historically fallen, with green, unripe flavors and tannins and a dry, bitter finish. This wine was not helped by the cool vintage.",83,18,California
45770,US,"It's hard to get around the slap of high alcohol in this wine, beginning with its diesel-oak nose and ever-present persistence of drying tannins. Bitter tea, cedar and leather add to the bombastic nature of this powerhouse.",83,130,California
45780,Spain,"Burnt, acrid, sweaty aromas are less than appealing. This tastes weedy and bitter, while the finish is sour, stalky and underripe.",81,10,Northern Spain
45790,Italy,"Aromas of wild berry, forest floor, new leather, grilled herb, menthol and dark spice all come together on this full-bodied red.

46010,Portugal,"One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character.

46060,US,"There's lots of flavor going on here for a modest price. It starts with sharp, well-defined red fruit, tight and acidic, but interesting and nuanced.

It is a beautifully balanced wine that is ready to drink.",94,97,Champagne
46170,France,"Superripe mirabelles and the juiciest pears appear on the nose and fill the mind with heady perfume. The palate confirms this notion of sweetness with ample residual sugar. However, this is met with precise acidity to create unusual thrill. This just sits on a knife's edge between juicy ripe pear and mouth-watering grapefruit zest—a wonderful interplay of notions that makes this incredibly enticing. This is starting to develop and has way to go with its playful, medium-dry finish. Drink 2017??030.",94,26,Alsace
46180,US,"With fruit from the Hames Valley AVA, this Morgan Hill-based winery delivers distinct aromas of pomegranate-glazed mushrooms and red pepper spice.

46200,US,"The nose on this wine from the longtime Santa Ynez Valley producer is a bit faint, with wet lawn and lemon most apparent. The palate is more sensation-based than flavor-driven, all about light texture and simmering acidity, with green apple and lime skin elements.",89,15,California
46210,South Africa,"This wine has an exuberant, juicy quality to it that is extremely attractive for solo sipping. Bright berry and spice on the nose are followed by mouthwatering, round fruit in the mouth. Pepper and spice mingle with good structure and a long finish, making this an impressive showing from Schultz.",87,37,Stellenbosch
46220,Chile,"Normally the Maipo Valley produces warm, dull Sauvignon Blancs. But this one has more kick and purity of fruit than most. The nose delivers tropical and melon aromas, while the palate is packed with lime, citrus and grapefruit flavors. It's on the big side and a little clingy on the finish, but mostly it gets things right.",87,10,Maipo Valley

46250,US,"Sunny and warm on the nose with aromas of honey, roasted hazelnuts and a touch of petroleum, this medium-bodied dry Riesling surprises with an unexpected austerity in the mouth. It's an interesting transition, however, resulting in a sleek, steely wine with hints of chalk dust, bitter lime and canned pineapple flavors.",86,17,New York

46300,US,"This workhorse vineyard supplies grapes to a wide variety of wines across the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio, but the vineyard-designated wines are much more limited, and they're often the best of show. As the alcohol reaches 15.5%, this selection is sappy, dense and a bit warm. There's plenty of fruit flavor and concentration, but it's difficult to pair such a blockbuster with food.",89,28,Washington
46310,Italy,"Bramaluce is a blend of Sangiovese and Syrah that opens with bold aromas of ripe fruit, blackberry jam and prune. The smoky finish adds a sophisticated twist. Some of the grapes used in the blend are air-dried on bamboo mats for added intensity.",89,23,Tuscany

46370,US,"Buttercream, sweet butter, marmalade, baking spice, brown sugar and sea salt converge on the nose of this bottling, named after the Foley family's Texas ranches.

A powerful burst of acidity starts the palate, which combines red currant and purple-flower flavors into a very interesting and lively wine.",91,22,California
46390,US,"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging. Otherwise it is a simple and perfectly pleasant, no-frills red.",85,36,Washington

46420,US,"Mourvèdre (81%) makes up the majority of this blend with Grenache (12%) and Syrah filling it out. It leans into savory notes, with aromas of sage, dried herbs, white pepper and mineral.

46430,Spain,"Aromas of rooty berry, loamy dark plum and minerally crispness create a fine nose that offers notes of coffee and char as it unfolds.

Drink through 2018.",92,30,Levante
46440,Chile,"Stocky, wild and needing to breathe, this is one foxy, jumpy wine with olive, herbal and animal aromas. It's requisitely big and jammy, with mocha and maple flavors accenting dark, driving berry fruit. Pours on the chocolate, oak and power as it unrolls.",89,22,Colchagua Valley
46450,Chile,"Black on the bouquet, with charred aromas vying with pepper and blackberry. Feels good but choppy, with firm acidity and solid flavors of wild berry, plum, vanilla and chocolate.

46480,US,"The vineyard produces everything from Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc to Chardonnay and Syrah for the winery, with generally good results. This Pinot shows the exotic notes of wildland herbs and pine that so often show up in Fort Ross-Seaview Pinots. But it's also rich in cherries, and the acidity is just about perfect. With a delicacy of mouthfeel, it's a fine example of coastal Pinot Noir, but it needs time. Give it until 2020.",92,75,California
46490,Argentina,"Berry, plum and raw oak are common aromas for a young, high-end Malbec from Mendoza.

46570,Italy,This opens with unusual charred aromas and whiffs of resin. The palate retains the same burnt sensations alongside notes of roasted coffee bean and bitter walnut husk. It lacks fruit richness and ends on an astringent note that dries out the mouth.,85,40,Veneto
46580,US,"Tasty and toasty, young and compact, this is a wine to cellar for a few more years at least. The bright fruit flavors run from berry to Bing cherry, not as dark as in some years, but vibrant and crisp. The new oak is not yet fully integrated, so give it some extra bottle age for optimal enjoyment.",92,75,Washington

46610,US,"Heavy, soft and a little sweet, this lacks the vibrant dryness and zest a good Pinot should have. The blackberry and cherry flavors have a slightly burnt, pie-filling flavor. Domaine Chandon has done better with Pinot Noir in the past, and it can do better than this.",84,65,California

46700,France,"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.",93,57,Loire Valley
46710,US,"This is really one of the best values in Cabernet- on the market. It's so deliciously rich in blackberry, currant and chocolate, you'll want to drink the whole bottle right now. Kudos to winemaker Nick Goldschmidt for producing a wine this good at such a good price.",91,21,California
46720,Austria,"A big wine in every sense—including its heavy bottle—this is as dense as Zweigelt gets.

As it develops, this will show impressive depth of flavor.",91,60,Neusiedlersee

46740,Chile,"Peachy and a little sharp on the nose, but the palate is smooth and glides along nicely, and the flavors of citrus, honey and caramel are good and hold form through the finish. You can definitely taste the botrytis here, especially on the finish. Fresh and not at all funky. Drink now through 2013.",87,14,Colchagua Valley
46750,US,"Doesn't taste quite ripe, with very dry, herbal flavors and also a strong hit of acidity. Almost suggests wintergreen sour candy, although there's some decent cherry and cola, accented, of course, by oak. Awkward, but could just be young. Hard to tell.",87,60,California
46760,Italy,"Mazzei, the family behind Fonterutoli in Chianti, is the maker of this 100% Sangiovese, which offers a strong, piercing nose of earth, leather, red fruit and oak.

47130,US,"A majority varietal, this wine also holds small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. These combine well with one another to exude notes of licorice, plum and black cherry.

47190,US,"This blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc has a serious line of minerality apparent on the nose as well as pear blossom, pineapple-guava skin and a dairy tang. The palate clings to Meyer lemon pith and Greek yogurt flavors.",90,24,California
47200,Chile,"Smells a little strange, baked and like corn. And as it airs out, it shows a mealy, cider-like side. In the mouth, there's sweet pineapple flavors and then a thin finish.

47310,US,"A very good wine, although a very young one that needs time. It's not because the tannins are hard, because they're not.

The grapes come from a tenderloin of the appellation that's known for quality. Best after 2009.",91,60,California
47320,US,"A first-class Zin that shows classic mountain character, at a very nice price. Dry and rich in tannins, it's explosive in briary, brambly wild berries, currants, dark chocolate and pepper, with a touch of raisins. Just delicious.",90,16,California

48410,France,"A perfumed wine that is spicy as well as crisp. It is full of ripe apples and hedgerow fruits, with a spring in its texture and a bright acidity at the end. The aftertaste shows more of the spiciness as well as a touch of typical Riesling steeliness.",87,15,Alsace
48420,US,"The deep, saturated color and vivid, smoky flavors indicate a monster wine, but the reality is more complex and interesting. It smells like boysenberry, grilled beef and black pepper, tastes grapey and berrylike but also roasted and savory. It is surprisingly light-bodied considering how flavorful it is.",87,24,California

The grace notes pile on—smoke, black olive, tar, tobacco leaf, bitter chocolate. Young, bracing, and built to age.",93,40,Washington
48570,Italy,"There's a polished mineral note here of lead pencil or graphite that gives this wine very direct and immediate appeal.

This beautiful wine can age many more years.",93,55,Tuscany

48630,Germany,"In a departure from Mosel stereotypes, this wine is missing the floral fragrance and vivacity so typical of the region.

48710,US,"Aged in 100% once-filled barrels, this smooth and savory wine blends four different Dijon clones. The spicy raspberry and cherry fruit coats the tongue, wrapped in light caramel and toast. It's a very pretty, elegant wine, drinking nicely already, but one that should continue to hold together well through 2020.",91,66,Oregon
48720,US,"Not a shy wine, this looks very dark and smells smoky and meaty.

It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way.",92,25,California
48760,New Zealand,"This is less luxuriantly ripe than some of the other 2013 Hawke's Bay Syrahs, showing some firm, dusty tannins on the finish, but it's still a terrific offering.

48810,Austria,"A beautifully perfumed wine, this is very mineral and steely with currant flavors, a splash of lime and complex acidity. Behind this, there is a more ripe character, with richness and a warmer feel. Great acidity and youthfulness promise several years' aging. Screwcap.",91,,Nieder?sterreich
48820,US,"This Pinot is too tart and tannic to drink now, though it has great potential. You have to search for the fruit, but it's there, in deeply hidden layers of cherries and red currants.

48830,US,"With stainless steel-fermentation and time in oak, this seamless, elegant white is stony in mineral notes and inviting in aromas of white flowers. Lurking golden-honey and crème-br?lée richness add texture and body, while the finish becomes clear and crisp.",90,22,California

48900,US,"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted.

At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry.",97,55,Washington
48910,Spain,"Year in and year out, this around where this wine shakes out. The nose is clean and nice for an under-$10 white, with minerality and fresh white-fruit aromas.

48960,US,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show.

48990,US,"A standout in the portfolio, this is a sleek, strong effort with tart purple fruits and mineral underpinnings. There's an ample whiff of smoke and a general earthiness around the tannins, with a hint of iron ore. The chalky finish is the only distraction.",89,25,Oregon
49000,US,"As the top tier wine from this producer, this Pinot sees 10 months in new French oak which gives an inital char to the nose.

49140,US,"Third in Three Brothers' series of four Rieslings, this bottling is accurately labeled as semi-sweet, although certainly sweeter than the 1st Degree.

49150,Spain,"Palacio Quemado, which means the Burnt Palace, is a funky wine from Extremadura that mixes forceful floral aromas with barnyard and grape juice scents. It's a fuller-bodied, grabby wine with chunky, medicinal flavors and a finish that meanders before settling on big and herbal. Has its good points and weaknesses.",84,15,Central Spain
49160,Australia,"Medium-bodied and a little viscous in the mouth, this value Chard is no fruit bomb, as are many others at this price.

49180,Australia,"Has a nice citrus-pear core, but the fruit wears a strange faux-sweetness (really, it tastes like saccharine) that was a little offputting. Still, it's a nice wine, with medium body and nice resiny and creamy notes on the nose.",86,20,South Australia
49190,Austria,"Lemon peel and yeast are in the starring roles for now, showing miso-like savor with smoky edges and glimpses of white pepper. The fruit will come later. For now, this is pure, textural pleasure, with a very clean-cut finish.",92,44,Wachau

49250,Spain,"This funky rosé is made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, and there's color, spice aromas and weight dictated by that grape mix. Heavy plum and cherry flavors are fruity but flat in feel, with no cut to the finish. This is interesting but not refreshing.",84,15,Catalonia

49380,Spain,"This is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.",83,9,Northern Spain
49390,Spain,"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish. A blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.",82,10,Levante

The bright refreshing palate doles out golden apple, tangerine zest and a hint of almond alongside crisp acidity.",91,,Tuscany
49520,France,"This off-dry character is a hard style to work well. This wine succeeds because it has kept a dry background as well as strong minerality, so the almond-perfumed character of the wine is beautifully restrained and delicate. Drink the wine from 2019.",87,18,Loire Valley
49530,France,"This is a dry style of rosé. Packed with red currant and berry fruits, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Grolleau has a touch of spice to add extra interest. It is perfumed, crisp and ready to drink young.",87,14,Loire Valley

49550,US,"This is one of the few Zinfandels with a Rutherford appellation. It's quite a good wine, deliciously easy to drink with its creamy texture and dry, soft flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and licorice, made all the more zesty with peppery spices. Great job by veteran winemaker Scott McLeod. From Francis Ford Coppola and Rubicon.",91,45,California
49560,France,"Under the watchful eye of consultant Michel Rolland, Candale has produced an intense, powerful expression of super-ripe Merlot. The tannins are dense, powering through the dark berry fruit, rounded by the wood. It could do with 4?? years aging.",91,55,Bordeaux
49570,Italy,La Gerla delivers a soft and succulent texture with rich tones of milk chocolate and fudge behind layers of cherry and wild berry.

49580,Argentina,"This bold, burly wine has a pretty shine to it. Attractive honey, melon and buttered-toast aromas dance on the nose, and the creamy yet structured palate offers coconut and banana flavors along with proper acids.

49590,US,"This is a light wine—light   in fruit, acid and tannins, and light in body. That doesn't mean it doesn't offer a lot of pleasure. It does. It has complex herbal, berry and spice flavors, and it's nicely dry, with a certain richness. It's a great wine for early drinking.",89,25,California
49600,US,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2?? years of aging.",91,35,California
49610,US,"A beautiful white wine notable for its extreme dryness and fresh crispness of acidity. Really cleanses the mouth, letting it appreciate the unoaked flavors of tangerine, melon, peach and minerals. A brilliant wine to drink with almost anything, but especially shellfish.",91,17,California

49640,US,"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.",95,60,California

49660,US,"The blend is about two-thirds Pinot Gris and one-third Viognier. Pretty orange-blossom scents lead it off, and it has good acid balance and lots of lemony fruit. Yet it still feels like two separate wines coming together. Spice and pear flavors open up in the glass with a little swirling.",87,11,Washington

49710,US,"Powerful and elegant aromas of tobacco, dark herbs, cedar and a touch of green pepper keep the nose entertained for quite a while. There's a peppery, meaty character to the palate, with purple fruits arising over time. This one will be even better in a few years.",91,28,California
49720,Australia,"This is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit. Despite the dark plum and cherry fruit, the impression is one of tautness and freshness. Drink it with red meat now, or give it until 2017 to settle down.",91,32,South Australia

49740,US,"Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex mélange of flavors, in a balanced structure.

49750,US,"Tight, tart and nearly effervescent aromas of pear cider greet the nose on this bottling, which features a Spanish dancer on the label.

This finishes medium sweet with lingering flavors of both zest and peach.",91,26,Alsace
49830,US,"A Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this red wine is dry and rich in currant and cedar flavors. But it's a little sharp and green in tannins, with a tart mouthfeel. A good steak will help, but it's not really an ager, so drink up.",86,36,California
49840,Australia,"Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group.

It's rich but never tiring.",90,20,Washington
49890,France,"In the strange world of Champagne, Sec (dry) on the label means a wine that is less dry than Brut. It is more to do with fullness and weight than sugar. This wine bears ripe fruit, flavors of peaches, creamy pears and light nougat and spice character. Pair this with richly sauced foods.",90,100,Champagne

49950,Austria,"A deliberately oxidized style makes for an immensely intriguing wine that falls between the usual Austrian categories—but then we need wines that defy neat boxes. Aromas of toasted cashew nuts and dried orange peel segue into a dryish, citrus-scented palate, with a central, thick slick of salted caramel and racy acidity. The longer you taste, the more facets appear, even as the palate fades into notions of salty, candied mandarin zest. Unusual and uncategorisable, but unforgettable. Despite being called Apéritif, it might be best with cheese and tapas.",93,42,Burgenland

49980,US,"This boasts appealing tropical fruit flavors that have been generously oaked. The honey quality lends smoothness and a round mellowness, and the finish is quite dry. It shows a softness some may fault, but this is ultimately delicious, and it will be a great accompaniment to rich shellfish.",90,28,California

50100,US,"Ultrarich and fruity, this Cabernet shows the grapey ripeness Paso Robles is famous for. The wine is fresh and jammy in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. It's a little one-dimensional, and the alcohol is very high, but not hot. Drink now.",89,75,California
50110,Germany,"From a usually reliable producer and a top vineyard site, this is a bit of a disappointment. Some floral, apple-y notes grace the predominantly crushed-stone aromas, while the impression on the palate is broad and slightly unfocused.",84,40,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer

50150,Italy,"Crushed berry, leather, scorched earth, carob and underbrush are just some of the aromas offered by this powerfully structured Brunello.

The palate is fresh but tight and drying, with raspberry flavors and cherry skins and tomato on the finish. A red-dominant wine.",83,16,Mendoza Province
50210,France,"Ripe and fruity, this wine brings out apricot and pear flavors. It is rounded, full of fruit as well as balanced acidity. It is ready to drink but will be better from late 2015.

Drink 2020??027.",92,,Tuscany
50380,US,"A solid Pinot Noir, this is surprisingly good for the price. It shows a delicate texture and plenty of dry elegance, along with flavors of tobacco, pomegranate and sour cherry candy. It should be relatively easy to find, with 40,000 cases produced.",86,15,California

50460,Australia,"Perhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.",87,30,South Australia
50470,Spain,"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak.

50480,Spain,"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish. It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",86,82,Spanish Islands
50490,Australia,"Despite tipping the scales at more than 15% alcohol, this wine actually comes across as nicely structured and elegant. It's certainly not a fruit bomb, instead offering a complex array of sour plum, espresso, olive and coffee notes to go with its blueberry fruit.

50500,US,"This is Morrison Lane's first Dolcetto—previously these grapes were blended into the winery's Nebbiolo. The color is dark and saturated, the plummy fruit flavors laced with spice and leaf.

50550,France,"It's certainly a big wine, as befits Madiran, but the tannins are well tamed, and contribute to richness rather than dryness. The texture is rough velvet, a smoothness topped by some tannins. Fruit flavors range from black figs to dark plum skins. It could evolve over 5 years, at least.",91,26,Southwest France
50560,US,"This bottling combines, as usual, ripe tropical fruits, oak and minerals with excellent acidity to yield a wine that's opulent in the way of a rich Chardonnay, yet balanced and elegant.

50570,France,"Full bodied and richly textured, this wine stood out in a flight of southern Rh?nes for its obvious oak. It's a toasty, cedary, vanilla-laden wine, but with enough fruit weight to support the wood. Drink it now if you like that style, or give it a few years' in the cellar and see if the fruit emerges over time.",90,32,Rh?ne Valley
50580,Argentina,"Jammy berry fruits, violet notes and graham cracker define the bouquet on this high-quality, good-value Malbec. The palate isn't huge but it's well structured, and the flavors are exotic and out of the ordinary, with an emphasis on Middle Eastern spice and blue-fruit flavors. On the finish, it's chocolaty and spicy but loses steam quickly.",90,18,Mendoza Province

With a dark background to the black-currant fruits, this needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,30,Southwest France
50710,Italy,"Mature berry, new leather, spice and balsamic aromas lead the nose.

50810,France,"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.",95,310,Burgundy

51140,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",85,30,California
51150,Chile,"Mild apple and citrus aromas are simple and clean. A light, tangy palate with virtually no weight tastes of pithy citrus fruits and tropical papaya. Light on the finish, this fades away quietly.",87,15,Maipo Valley
51160,Chile,"Rubber and asphalt aromas dominate the nose of this high-acid coastal Syrah that's about as shearing as they come (only 12% abv). Additional scents of olive and savory plum feed into a tight palate that lives on a hard beam of natural acidity. Flavors of tomato and citrus are tart and end with a raw, juicy finish.",87,50,San Antonio
51170,France,"The slightest hint of pineapple shows on the nose, followed by a just off-dry fruitiness on the palate. This wine is clean and should be drink while still fresh.",87,18,Alsace
51180,France,"Sand (sable) is indeed the color of this palest of rosés. The style is intense, as much wine as sparkling wine, flavored with raspberries and red currants, and some pear spice. It is definitely for food, with its acidity and fine freshness.",90,,Champagne
51190,US,"Fresh and immediately appealing for its silky texture and forward flavors of cherries, cotton candy, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak. But this is no mere taste treat. It's a serious, layered Pinot Noir, whose vital balance will help it evolve over the next six years.",90,45,California
51200,Spain,"Yellow in color, with heavy dusty flat aromas of apple and citrus, this feels low on acidity and thus flat. Cidery apple and lime flavors finish chunky and leesy with an oily texture.",85,15,Galicia
51210,US,"This is an intense, somewhat unformed vineyard-designate, ripe with sweet tannins that takes on considerable barrel flavors of vanilla and caramel.",85,39,California
51220,France,"The name, Haut Pa?s means high country in the local southwest dialect and this wine comes from the hills of the eastern Dordogne. It is light and fruity, a cool wine with some attractive, ready-to-drink red fruits and just a touch of structure.",84,,Southwest France
51230,Chile,"This is almost brutally austere. The nose expresses nothing but grass and zest, and the palate is sharp in feel, with chiseled, raw power and pithy, stony flavors of lemon, grapefruit and sour orange. This is overpowering and clipped; it has merits but needs to be more friendly.",84,25,Colchagua Costa
51240,Spain,"Punchy grapefruit aromas come with a touch of minerality. An oily yet spritzy feeling palate doesn't score many points, while the flavor profile is bitterness offset by pithy citrus flavors.",83,14,Central Spain

51300,Spain,"Cheesy oak aromas and murky fruit scents are less than what Atauta usually offers. Chalk it up to the rough conditions of chilly 2013. In the mouth, this is choppy. Roasted berry and earthy notes precede a tannic, rubbery finish.",86,35,Northern Spain

51330,US,"This smooth and supple wine has been aged in 65% new oak, yet does not seem at all oaky. A solid core of black fruits is annotated with streaks of coffee, licorice and gun metal.

51360,France,"Vines planted in 1939 by the current winemaker's grandfather give an impressively ripe wine. It is dense with concentrated tannins, smoky red fruits and still youthful acidity.

51370,US,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style.

Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now??014.",95,55,California
51380,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",94,35,California
51390,US,"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6?? years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",93,150,California
51400,Italy,"This bright sparkler is redolent of yellow flower, peach, citrus and baked bread. There's also a slightly pungent note of apple skin or apricot that gives the bouquet lift and momentum.",85,15,Piedmont
51410,US,"There's a vegetal touch to the raspberries and cherries that compromises this Pinot Noir. It's nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with a silky texture, but it's not likely to improve with age, so drink up.",85,42,California
51420,Italy,This opens with slightly green aromas of eucalyptus and mint with ginger and sour berry in the background. There's a strong menthol note on the close.,85,30,Piedmont

51440,US,"This blend is 74% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot. Locked up vanilla, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to high-octane dark-fruit flavors, with the heat providing some distraction.",88,53,Washington
51450,Italy,"The nose doesn't give much away while the tight palate offers mature black cherry, mint and a hint of baking spice. Fresh and tannic but one-dimensional, it lacks charm.",88,34,Tuscany
51460,US,"This wine starts on intense aromas of charred oak and roasted nuts. It eventually gives way to stone fruits and marmalade that, while soft on the nose, are stronger on the fruit-forward palate. Nutty flavors and rough oak seem out of place among the fresh fruit and viscous mouthfeel, and makes for a long yet disjointed finish.",84,25,Virginia
51470,Italy,"?ber-simple and rather diluted, this offers sour cherry and notes suggesting sweet and sour sauce. It's vigorous with vivacious acidity.",83,15,Veneto
51480,France,"A complex, ripe wine from a fine single-vineyard site, it has rich yellow and citrus fruits that are right up front. Behind, the texture is steely and nervy, with intense herbaceous acidity. It's full of potential, so wait until 2016.",91,,Loire Valley

51510,Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",85,12,Mendoza Province

51570,Argentina,"Like the winery's Gran Reserva '08, this is a saturated bomber that rides along the edge of overripeness. Aromas of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and coconut are rich and oaky. It feels tannic, with a beam of shrill acidity that props up flavors that otherwise might seem raisiny or pruney. Chocolate and wood resin tones pile up on the finish.",90,80,Mendoza Province

51740,Austria,"Fresh pear peel, ripe pear fruit and a touch of citrus make for an inviting, appetizing nose. The palate takes all this fruit as a backdrop on which to display both herb and spice: white pepper, chervil, miso and salt. This interplay of spice and fruit is savory, slender and vivid, giving a moreish, totally balanced wine.",92,17,Weinviertel

52230,US,"This new cuvée is 60% Malbec, 35% Syrah and the rest Merlot. It seems to have been given extra barrel time, and the overpowering and heavy toast scents and flavors dominate. The raspberry fruit flavors are somewhat buried as a result, and the wine seems over-matched. But more bottle age may help to open it up.",87,50,Washington
52240,Spain,"Year in and year out, this around where this wine shakes out. The nose is clean and nice for an under-$10 white, with minerality and fresh white-fruit aromas. A light, focused palate offers up green melon, apple, herb and white pepper flavors in front of a crisp finish. This varietal Viura outperforms its price.",87,9,Northern Spain
52250,US,"The wine is equally sharp, with a spicy blend of Bordeaux grapes that show brambly berry adorned with highlights of pine needle and a thread of smoke. It would be no surprise if this aged quite well for up to a decade, but it's priced for near-term enjoyment.",87,20,Washington

52270,Chile,"This unusual combo of Malbec and Syrah starts with hickory and campfire aromas and then medicinality enters the picture. The palate is choppy and features many holes in the road, but there's also solid black fruit flavors along with cocoa and berry syrup on the finish. In addition, the acidity seems high.",84,13,Maule Valley

52370,Argentina,"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.",87,24,Mendoza Province
52380,US,"Shows brilliantly crisp acidity giving a jammy brightness to the pineapple, lemon and lime fruit flavors, and the finish is totally dry. Not particularly complex, but an easy-drinking Chardonnay.",87,24,California
52390,South Africa,"With 22 to 24 months in new French oak, there's a lot of richness to this wine in the form of raspberry sauce, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction. There's plenty of fruit to support those heavy flavors, though, with vibrant cherry and plum flavors in the medium weight mouth. Cola and spice add interest to the close.",87,17,Coastal Region
52400,France,"Chenin Blanc dominates this attractive wine, giving a nutty, almond and honey character. Stewed pear is balanced with lime acidity in a fruity contrast. The wine is aromatic, lively and ready to drink.",87,19,Loire Valley
52410,US,"Generous and fruity aromas of baked blackberry and blueberry syrup show on this blend of 48% Merlot, 45% Zinfandel, 4% Primitivo, 2% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Sauvignon, along with an underlying rockiness.

52430,US,"A toasty aroma greets you, from 20 months in 70% new French oak. There's plenty of fruit as well, concentrated mulberry and boysenberry annotated with ultradark chocolate. You may lay this one down until 2024.",90,32,Washington
52440,US,"Consistent with past versions of this reserve-level Cabernet, this new vintage is smooth and sweetly fruity, with plenty of new oak aging under its belt. The tannins are ripe and svelte, and a streak of iron and licorice runs right down the spine. Drink now through 2020.",90,53,Washington
52450,US,"Soothing menthol and green floral notes lend vibe to crisp sour-cherry flavors in this bold, penetrating Bordeaux-style blend. It's rich and brawny on the palate with juicy, primary cherry and plum flavors, yet streaked with delicate touches of oak and earth.",90,35,New York
52460,Italy,"Altesino is part of an elite group of vintners that really put Montalcino on the international wine map.

52470,Italy,Girifalco is an interesting expression of Sangiovese that shows a very bold and modern side to this characteristic grape from central Italy. Dark blackberry and prune are backed by thick concentration with lingering tobacco and chocolate.,90,55,Tuscany
52480,US,"This rich, layered red wine is a bit jammy and assertive now, and will benefit from a couple years of cellaring to settle down. It's forward and ripe with cherry and raspberry jam, mocha, roasted almond and cinnamon flavors. A little heavy and heady, yet strangely compelling, and certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor.",90,90,California

52540,France,"Soft and fruity, this is ripe with a gentle character from a high dosage (sugar syrup that tops up the bottle after they freeze the neck to pop out old yeast cells). This light-colored wine is perfumed with the scent of wild strawberries.",87,40,Champagne
52550,Uruguay,"Stewed black plum, brandied cherry, licorice and raisin aromas are very ripe and chocolaty. This is dense and a bit ponderous on the palate, with raisin, cassis, kirsch, black pepper and caramel flavors that finish sticky and a touch fiery. In many ways, this red-grape-based sweetie is similar to Pedro Xímenez from Sherry country.",87,45,Juanico
52560,US,"American oak stands out on the nose, before this wine offers bright red raspberry, blackberry and an unexpected crispness. A follow-up of orange peel and clove confuses in pleasant ways, before the finish repeats the oak. Still young, this wine will benefit from airing.",87,26,California

Plush and irresistible.",93,45,Washington
52790,Spain,"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors.

Drink now through 2018.",93,150,Northern Spain
52800,US,"Tastes jammy and sharp, like a barrel sample, with acidic flavors of raspberries, black cherries and spices. The tannins are rich and smooth. A very good wine, but bristly and tough in youth. Give it a few years to mellow.",87,27,California
52810,Chile,"It's not easy distinguishing one Emiliana Chardonnay from the other; they're all more or less similar. Novas shows a touch of match stick and aromatic harshness, which is offset by softer melon and peach aromas. The palate is full and pulpy, with melony, obtuse flavors. Good for Chile, and decidedly not bitter or pithy",87,15,Casablanca Valley

52850,France,"A vineyard on the river plain of Saint-?milion, Haut-Pezat has produced a wine whose full black fruits handle strong wood-aging flavors with ease.

Well-integrated, it shows restraint without sacrificing body, its nuances developing slowly in the glass.",92,60,California
52880,Portugal,"A rich wood-aged wine, this is dense and creamy. With acidity and toast, ripe apples as well as spice, the wine is made to age.

Drink 2017??026.",94,88,Veneto
52920,US,"This bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard is light and easy on the nose, with ripe apples, sharp herbs, moss and an inherent grassy character deep within.

It's one of the better Sauv Blancs of the vintage.",92,26,California
52930,France,"A blend from different parts of the Fleurie appellation, this wine is elegant and floral. Crisp red fruits are sustained by acidity and by a juicy character. As often with this appellation, it is a wine to age and will be better from 2018.",92,20,Beaujolais
52940,Italy,"This wine's truffle, underbrush, dark berry and baking spice aromas take center stage.

The wine also has youth on its side and could age for several more years. Drink from 2014.",91,,Vinho Verde

54430,US,"Light red fruits with a suggestion of mint carry notes of leather, cedar and smoke. The blend includes 10% Merlot, and the wine spent 24 months in French oak, 15% new. Complex and balanced, with a streak of black olive, it's not a big wine, but well made and ready to drink.",88,38,Oregon
54440,Argentina,"Basic, fresh, honest aromas of red-berry fruits and spice set up a wide, easygoing palate with cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors. Only on the finish does one detect some acidity and rawness. Overall this is a nice Cab for casual drinking.",87,,Mendoza Province

54490,Chile,"Tropical fruits and a mix of grass and green herbs make for a nice bouquet. The palate on this Casablanca wine is juicy and round, not pointy, with citrus and nectarine flavors. Finishes with green apple tang; definitely gets the job done.",87,15,Casablanca Valley
54500,France,"The C?te des Bar is the source of grapes for this Aube-based producer, now in the family's eighth generation. This dry rosé gets its richness from ripe red Pinot Noir cut with refreshing citrus acidity from the Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc. The Pinot Noir also adds texture. Drink now.",90,56,Champagne
54510,Portugal,"As befits a reserve wine, this blend was aged in wood for six months. That has given a ripe lightly toasty character to the wine along with its cool crispness that reveals its origin in the mountainous northern Alentejo. The wine is fruity with lemon and melon over the wood. Drink now.",90,22,Alentejano
54520,US,"An almost buttery aroma and attractive peach, apricot and honey flavors give this dry, light-bodied wine a lot of personality. Nicely balanced, and smooth on the palate, it keeps unfolding more flavor nuances as it breathes.",90,29,California
54530,New Zealand,"This dark-fruited Pinot Noir is sturdily constructed yet never seems hard or tough, thanks to the silkiness of its plentiful tannins. Black cherry fruit picks up shadings of mocha on the dusty finish. Drink 2015??020.",90,30,Central Otago
54540,US,"A big, robust, brawny wine, proud of being Petite Sirah and making no apologies for its take-no-prisoners approach. Enters the mouth with a blast of wild berries, tobacco and spices, wrapped into big, tough tannins, and doesn't stop kicking through a long, spicy finish. Great now as a summer barbecue wine.",88,30,California
54550,Chile,"Jammy berry, oak and rubbery aromas are round and harmonious. In the mouth, this blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is lively and electric, with raspberry, plum and cherry flavors resting in front of a smooth finish with vanilla and chocolaty flavors.",88,12,Colchagua Valley
54560,France,"Crémant de Loire is the Loire-wide sparkling wine appellation. This wine, with its blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay, shows a crisp character, its acidity given brightness by lemon and green-plum fruit flavors. There's an attractive edge of minerality to add some tautness to the wine.",88,14,Loire Valley
54570,New Zealand,"This is a full-bodied, soft and round style of Pinot Gris that's almost completely dry. Understated pear and melon aromas combine with hints of fern fronds to create an enchanting bouquet, while the flavors are more straightforward and fruity. Drink now.",88,17,Marlborough

54600,Argentina,"Supposedly Do?a Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",84,35,Mendoza Province
54610,Italy,"Lucente is made from a blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. You get a lot of bang for your buck thanks to rich, velvety tones of chocolate, spice and forest berry that last over a long, succulent finish.",90,25,Tuscany
54620,Italy,"You'll recognize this Sangiovese immediately thanks to pristine notes of blue flowers, chalky soil, sage and Mediterranean herbs. It has a thinner, delicate texture in the mouth but ends with bright, vibrant crispness.",90,200,Tuscany

54650,US,"Tough in the mouth, and chewy, like a gristly piece of steak you can't quite break down. It's certainly rich in blackberry, black currant and smoky oak flavors, and is properly dry and brisk in acidity. But you have to wonder if that toughness will ever age out.",86,40,California

54690,France,"Late harvest rather than botrytized, although here the richness and the superripe fruit have something of the same effect.

54710,US,"For some reason, the budget-priced Two Vines Chardonnay lags its pricier siblings by a vintage or two. It's beginning to flatten out as a result, the freshness fading, though the fruit is still there and it is a pleasant effort, with some buttered apple flavors dominant.",86,8,Washington
54720,Portugal,"Produced from old vines, this big and rounded wine has dark, dusty tannins that come from the concentrated fruit flavors as much as the wood. It comes from a producer whose main quinta, S?o Bernardo, was created in 1912. It is a dense, brooding wine that shows great weight and power. Black plum, dark berries and intense acidity are there in richness and profusion. Drink from 2018.",93,,Douro
54730,France,"This is a full-bodied, dense wine. A hint of austerity in the mineral texture gives the wine a steely core. Around this center, ripe fruit fills out the wine and gives apricots and generous fruitiness as well as a crisp, perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",93,38,Burgundy

54770,Spain,"This is a dark, fully formed and impressive wine, one that's 70% Tempranillo and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Drink now??017.",92,47,Northern Spain
54780,US,"Superbly delicious, and packed with ripeness and style. Shows the characteristics of Donum's regular 2010 Carneros, with extra depth and complexity. Waves of raspberries and cherries, licorice, mocha, wood spice and vanilla wash across the palate, always changing in fascinating ways. Should age well for up to a decade.",92,90,California
54790,France,"A wine that keeps close to the dense path of Yannick Amirault's wines. Firm, dark and with strong elements of wood aging, this is solid and chunky. Perhaps there is a touch too much extraction, but this is mitigated by the rich black plum and berry fruits and final. lifted acidity. Age for 4?? years.",92,,Loire Valley
54800,US,"A bit heavy now, with lots of unintegrated parts. The new oak sticks out from the tannins, and the blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit is all primary and jammy. If you drink now, decant, but this 100% Cab should be better after 2010.",87,36,California
54810,US,"This is a tough, dry wine that needs rich fare to balance it out. It's very tannic and sharp in acidity, with flavors of coffee, blackberries, dark unsweetened chocolate and spices. Should develop well for many years, gradually mellowing and sweetening.",87,26,California
54820,US,"A sound red wine that, at this price, proves its worth as a versatile, satisfying table companion to all sorts of foods calling for a full-bodied red. A blend of Syrah and Grenache, it's dry and tannic, with pleasant cherry, berry, herb and spice flavors.",87,10,California

54860,France,"This firm Malbec comes from old vines. It is concentrated and dense, while wearing its power easily and openly. Wood aging adds complexity as do the leather, dark chocolate and black fruits that are followed by juicy acidity. A wine with great potential, don't drink before 2018.",94,55,Southwest France
54870,US,"Few Chardonnays in California exhibit this fruit power. It's explosive in apricots, oranges, mangoes, lime and Meyer lemons, all enriched with sweet, toasty oak. With brisk acidity, it's a balanced wine, but too massive to appreciate now. Drink in 2?? years.",93,75,California
54880,US,"A Grenache-driven blend with 28% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this is a substantial, concentrated wine generous in leather, pipe tobacco and blackberry pie, accented teasingly in clove.

54900,France,"A touch of spice comes from the wood aging. This has plenty of fruit as well, promising a good future. Ripe and rich, this should age well, so drink from 2016. The Maurice Robert family winery, in the heart of Entre-Deux-Mers, is now in its third generation. The Sauve Majeure Benedictine abbey in the village is on the UNESCO World Heritage pilgrim route.",90,22,Bordeaux
54910,US,"A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable.",88,15,Oregon
54920,US,"This wine strikes a balance between crispness and fullness as it offers tart green apple aromas, richer, riper apple and Bosc pear flavors and a texture that's more rounded than sharp.",88,19,California
54930,France,"Balanced and fruity with its hints of red fruits, this is a light wine. The dominance of the two Pinot grapes gives it a slight texture and tannic edge although this is smoothed out by the soft finish from the relatively high dosage. Ready to drink now.",88,60,Champagne
54940,France,"This celebration of Tannat is a balanced while severe and structured wine. Plenty of juicy fruit is ready to come out from behind the dry, tannic structure. There is power here as well in this wine that is firm and needs to age. Drink from 2019.",93,15,Southwest France
54950,Portugal,"Powerful and tannic, this is a brooding wine that will need many years aging. It is powered by its dry core, with the structured red plum skin flavors adding to the sense of concentration. Drink from 2018.",93,,Tejo
54960,Chile,"This is a stately Cabernet housing classic Chilean aromas of spicy, berry fruits mixed with earth notes. It's supremely fresh on the palate, with layers of briar fruit and integrated oak. Baked berry, hard spice and exotic chocolate flavors end toasty and warm, but lively and complex. Drink through 2024.",93,76,Maipo Valley
54970,France,"Extra brut means that this Champagne is drier than most brut wines, while not totally dry as in brut zéro. This Extra Brut shows remarkable crispness, but also some ripeness with its apple and grapefruit flavors. It's one of those Champagnes that needs time to breathe, so open 30 minutes before you want to drink it—the bubbles won't disappear.",90,,Champagne
54980,France,"Very ripe, powerful and extracted, the wine has a bitter edge, a dark and tannic structure and a dense texture. With its edge of cocoa and layers of wood over the blackberry fruits, it's a wine that will need a while before drinking. Drink from 2016.",90,35,Bordeaux
54990,France,"Soft and rounded with ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine expresses the richness of the vintage. Hints of toast and cookie are changing the fruit character, making this a wine that's ready to drink while still fresh, yet starting to show good aging as well.",90,139,Champagne
55000,France,"A lovely blend of tart berry and red-apple notes creates an inviting nose. The palate brings these lovely, almost autumnal berry notes even further as they are amplified by the lively frothy mousse.

55010,US,"This easy-drinking wine is full of fruit in the aromas and flavors and has a smooth, non-tannic texture and full body. Its concentrated raspberry and red cherry aromas are followed by ripe plum and cherry flavors, with juicy acidity.",89,29,California
55020,Italy,"Floral scents of wisteria and hawthorn mingle with white stone-fruit aromas. On the creamy, rather sweet palate, bright acidity lifts green apple, white peach and candied lemon peel while a confectionery note wraps around the finish. It's polished, with a silky mousse.",89,18,Veneto
55030,US,"Crystal Valley is a Cosentino brand, and this single-vineyard wine is fruity and tasty, with the rich, honeyed texture of a fully ripe wine. Has a kiss of oak and a nice, long, citrusy finish.",85,14,California

55050,Chile,"Compact and full in the nose, with a fine level of berry fruit and some attractive wood spice. The mouth offers sweet berry flavors and some toasty oak, while the finish is round and soft. There's little complexity or style—what you smell and taste at first is what you get.",85,17,Lontué Valley
55060,Italy,"Made with organically grown Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara grapes, this opens with aromas suggesting black plum, baking spice and a touch of ginger. The vivacious palate shows raspberry jam, clove and white pepper alongside rather assertive tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,38,Veneto
55070,Portugal,"This fruity young wine has a ripe spring in its step. It has red-berry fruitiness as well as sweeter candied fruits balanced by an edge of spirit and acidity. This is an easy style of Port, ready to drink at any time.",87,14,Port
55080,France,"Named after the grandfather of the estate's present owners, this is a weird and wonderful blend that mixes the grapes of Bordeaux, Gaillac and places in between. Bottled without sulfur, it's fruity and juicy, with a strong edge of pepper and a touch of barnyard. Drink now.",87,17,Southwest France
55090,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors dominating the underlying tropical and citrus fruits. It has good acidity and a fine minerality, but feels overworked. Drink now.",86,48,California
55100,Italy,"Packaged in an elegant bottle with a squarish-squat shape, this pretty Rosé sparkler opens with aromas of Granny Smith apple, citrus and a touch of sweet peach. The perlage is tonic and steely and would pair with spicy Indian samosas.",85,19,Central Italy
55110,US,"No oak on this charming wine, so what you get is pure lemon, peach and mango fruit flavor. It's definitely on the rich side, and could use greater acidity to balance out the sugary finish.",85,15,California

55190,France,"One of the best sparkling wines produced in Saumur, this is textured, nervy and crisp, full of both fruit and secondary flavors. Touches of wood from the first fermentation in barrel give complexity and spice to the fruitiness. A yeasty, toasty aftertaste shows the wine's sophistication. Drink now.",92,,Loire Valley
55200,US,"Ignore the silly name and focus on the important particulars—old vine (planted 1976), wild yeast, biodynamic farming. Absolutely bone-dry yet bursting with complex minerality, citrus rind, and penetrating acidity, it has phenolics that give length, breadth and detail.",92,27,Oregon
55210,Portugal,"This rich, oak-aged wine is so smooth with yellow fruits, with just an edge of citrus and spicy, toasty character. It's a beautiful, generous wine, opulent in its ripe fruit while keeping a cool, salty character. The wine is still young, needing to bring out even further flavors. Drink from 2017.",92,35,Beira Atlantico
55220,Italy,"Prosecco Riva dei Fiori is executed in a Brut style (with low levels of sweetness) and offers compelling aromas of stone fruit, citrus and white stone. The mouthfeel is sharp and fresh and this wine would pair with seafood salad or calamari.",87,23,Veneto
55230,Italy,"Tonic and fresh with a creamy froth in the glass, this Prosecco is typical of this category. You'll get notes of lemon zest, peach and lime soda. In the mouth, the wine is lean and neutral but it does produce loads of fun creamy foam and froth.",87,18,Veneto
55240,US,"This powerfully ripe, direct Chardonnay shows massive flavors of pineapples, nectarines, green apples, vanilla and oaky buttered toast, brightened with crisp, coastal acidity. Nice with scallops in a saffron and coconut cream sauce.",87,32,California
55250,US,"Like its companion, Carpe Noctum, the Confero offers full flavors of cherry and berry, with spice and toast backing. Here the flavors are a touch lighter but perhaps more elegant and detailed, with suggestions of mint and caramel trickling through the finish.",91,34,Oregon

55270,France,"A rich wine, perfumed and intense. The tannins are a major element, although they ride with the sweet fruit and concentrated, complex wood and acidity. The wine is firm, impressively fruity and still likely to age further.",91,28,France Other
55280,US,"Bright lemon, nectarine and pineapple tones are touched with green herbs and savory pollen notes in this ephemerally sheer, light-bodied Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it boasts a mouth quenching grapefruit juiciness.",87,15,New York
55290,Chile,"This opens with a strong sense of oak and sawdust, later giving way to herbal berry aromas. This feels plump and resiny, with slick oak. Flavors of wood resin and pepper are on equal footing with berry flavors, while the finish shows moderate residual heat.",86,11,Maipo Valley

55330,US,"This is a dark, tarry wine, with a black cherry and cassis core that's accented by licorice and asphalt highlights. It's big but well built, a powerful red blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Petit Verdot. It seems to be trending into a somewhat pruny finish, and not likely to improve with further bottle age, so drink up.",87,35,Washington
55340,US,"This marks a change in style from Three Rivers's 2010, with noticeably less new oak influence and a much smaller production. The green apple and pineapple flavors have some sharpness, and the barrel fermentation (just 15% new oak) adds a biscuit-like note of vanilla wafer.",87,18,Washington
55350,US,"The color is absolutely black, except for royal purple at the rim of the glass. That just begins to suggest this wine's power. It's saturated in blackberry jam, black currants and chocolate, wrapped into huge tannins. The overall balance is fine, with a squirt of citrusy acidity. This wine defines a well-made California Petite Sirah, with Napa elegance. Fine to drink now with rich beef dishes and cheeses, and will live for decades, gradually shedding tannins and growing finer and sweeter.",92,40,California
55360,Spain,"There are wines with mass appeal and others that are so idiosyncratic that only one in five people might like it. This falls into the latter category; it's barrel-fermented Viura with Sherry, dry wood, butterscotch and corn cake aromas. The mouth is creamy and resiny, with integrated acidity that keeps it afloat. Flavors of spiced pear, vanilla, cinnamon and toffee suggest amontillado Sherry and something elusive yet refined. Drink now with a rich seafood dish like lobster or baked turbot.",91,28,Northern Spain
55370,US,"Give this Pinot two or three years in the cellar, and it could go a bit longer than that. In youth, it's tight in acidity, and the sweet oak and raspberry fruit flavors haven't come together yet. It shows a delightful silkiness and deeper complexities of mushrooms.",91,55,California
55380,US,"White pepper and a floral nose pique interest right away in this wine. A relatively light-bodied expression of the grape, it's soft in body and texture that persists in flavors of cinnamon stick.",88,50,California
55390,Argentina,"Dark-berry fruits, tomato and herbs make for a bouquet with ample power and varietal correctness. Big, blocky and fiercely tannic, this Cabernet tastes of roasted black fruits. A finish with heat, spice, oak-based clove and mint notes confirms a high level of oak that for the most part this can handle.",88,19,Mendoza Province

55410,Spain,"Leather and berry aromas are welcoming and veer toward mint. It feels solid and textured, with lightly oaked, earthy flavors of meaty berry and vanilla. It tastes roasted and shows medium intensity on the finish. A good crianza from a marginal vintage.",87,17,Northern Spain
55420,US,"Bright and lifted on the nose, this bears aromas of lemon peel, green apple and white peach, with accents of honeyed nut and wilted rose. The flavors mirror the aromas, showing very good concentration and lively acidity. The medium-long finish is zesty, warm and fresh.",86,20,Michigan

55450,US,"A 100% varietal wine fermented in stainless steel, this is a bright, lively tangle of cherry and orange built around bristling acidity that practically sizzles on the palate. Light-bodied and plenty crisp, it mellows to show length and breadth on the finish.",88,29,California
55460,France,"A warm and fruity wine, it is softly textured, ripe peach and apricot flavors. The acidity gives just enough freshness to a wine that is ripe, rounded and ready to drink.",84,,Burgundy

55490,Italy,"A perfect collaboration between two celebrated Tuscan estates, this plush wine is stacked tall with pretty aromas of cola, sweet spice, root beer, clove, toast and forest fruit. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine takes on marvelous shape in the mouth where it builds in intensity.",92,155,Tuscany
55500,Spain,"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold.

56650,US,"There's tremendous value in this well-made wine. It's savory in its mix of dried herb and plum notes, with smooth, softened tannins and judicious use of oak that lends richness to the palate. It'll appeal broadly.",90,23,California
56660,England,"Crisp green apple flavors are immediately apparent—lactic inflections and floral notes appear too, alongside wood sorrel and moist brioche. The palate has electric English acidity and a very creamy, fine mousse that gives shapely curves to its slenderness.",91,40,England
56670,Italy,"Fragrant and fresh, this offers scents of blue flowers, wild berry, moist earth, chopped herbs and a hint of baking spice. The vibrant, supple palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside fresh acidity. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink through 2016.",91,24,Piedmont
56680,US,"This ode-to-the laborers twist-top bottling is a solid sipper, with aromas of turned earth and black slate giving depth to black cherry and blueberry fruits that sit atop a mole sauce made from chocolate and dried bell peppers. The palate offers more dark fruit, chocolate and lava rocks, set amidst fine-grained tannins.",91,24,California
56690,Italy,"This opens with subdued aromas of French wood, grilled herb, forest floor and dark spice. The firmly structured palate shows espresso, toast, powdered sage and licorice but not much fruit richness. Grainy drying tannins leave an astringent mouthfeel.",87,50,Piedmont
56700,France,"Dense and well structured, this is going to be an attractive wine. It has blackberry fruit, plenty of crisp acidity and a structured aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",87,10,Bordeaux

56740,US,"Smooth and soft, this is a restrained Grenache intense in cranberry and Rainier cherry, easy to drink and love. Made in small quantities from a Lodi producer known for its Zinfandels, it demonstrates the potential of Grenache from the right place in the right hands.",89,32,California
56750,Austria,"Rich, but with a delicious aerial character, floating the white fruits over fresh acidity, green apple and peach flavors and a final delicate touch of mineral and spice. The wine is developing well, bringing forward its fine texture, delicate initially and then rounding in the mouth.",90,,Wachau
56760,New Zealand,"Leafy at first, but those greenish notes are backed by plenty of stone fruits and pineapple. It's plump and round in the mouth, with a long, clean, zesty finish. Drink now.",90,26,Marlborough
56770,Austria,"Nikolaihof's biodynamic viticulture shows through in the sheer purity of fruit in this wine.

The finish peels back the apple skin texture, leaving a delicious, clean mouthfeel.",90,,Wachau
56780,US,"The flavors of oak and cherries stand out in this fruity, softly appealing wine. It's almost like a pastry tart, with the smoky-sweet pie crust. It's delicious and appealing, although it could show a bit more depth and complexity.",89,48,California
56790,Spain,"A smooth wine for the price where all the dots connect. The nose has black cherry and raisin, while the palate is lush, deep and concentrated, with rewarding flavors of cherry, cassis and roasted plum. Lasting on the finish, with a licorice flavor. Very good wine for the money; Monastrell/Syrah/Tempranillo is the blend.",89,10,Levante
56800,Italy,"Cascina Saria is a relatively new producer in the Langhe, although the family has been growing grapes for generations. This Barbaresco shows tart aromas of berry fruit and white cherry, but it also offers accents of red apple, spice, wet earth and smoked bacon. There's more heft and consistency in the mouth, and the fruit flavors show the thick and chewy qualities of a hot vintage.",90,30,Piedmont
56810,Italy,"Here's a newly released Barolo that appears older than it actually is. The wine's ruby color shows a browning edge and aromas here reflect tertiary tones of balsam, drying mineral and licorice. In the mouth, you'll get iron-like flavors backed by fine, drying tannins. Don't wait too much longer to drink this wine.",89,,Piedmont
56820,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, integrated spices, licorice and tobacco are sturdy and almost heady. This feels layered, with structurally sound, slightly scraping tannins. Flavors of spicy cherry and cassis finish ripe, loamy and with a note of prune. Drink through 2020.",91,26,Northern Spain
56830,Argentina,"This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking, with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak, while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.",91,100,Mendoza Province
56840,France,"The limited-release reserve wine from a 21st century winery and one of the best vineyards in the Graves was wood aged for 24 months. That has given it extra richness and spice along with the dense blackberry fruits. It is complex, ripe with great ageability. Drink this wine from 2019.",91,31,Bordeaux
56850,Italy,"Extreme elegance and balance characterize Gianfranco Bovio's Barolo Rocchettevino.

56880,US,"Initial whiffs of smoke and spring ramps blow off with significant aeration, revealing fresh tart notes of raspberry and cherry. Dry and medium bodied in style, it's a refreshingly brisk Pinot Noir rosé that rewards those with patience.",86,18,New York
56890,US,"A brand new vineyard designation for the winery, Bedrock dates to the 1800s and is being made famous by proprietor Joel Peterson of Ravenswood and his son, Morgan Twain Peterson. This wine does the site justice, a smooth concoction of cherry pit and allspice, elegant and yet plenty generous in fruit and structure, measured by natural acidity.",92,50,California
56900,US,Scents of effervescent cherry and mint run with emergent licorice and slate on this wine that proves lithe yet flavorful on the palate. Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.,92,45,California
56910,US,"Made from grapes grown in Santa Barbara County's oldest commercial vineyard, one of the region's winemaking pioneers presents aromas of citrusy meringue atop a core of toasting wood. The wood vanishes on the palate, leaving light and racy apple spritzer flavors with a grand show of minerality.",91,38,California
56920,Italy,"Montesei shows authentic Soave Classico aromas of pear, stone fruit and dusty mineral at the back. Aged only in stainless steel in order to maintain its aromatic freshness, the wine feels smooth and richer than you'd expect on the palate.",87,15,Veneto
56930,Argentina,"This Cab is hard-capped on the nose, with chocolate, vanilla and plastic-like aromas. In the mouth, it's nervy and hints at astringency, while the flavor profile is led by lemony oak but also shows dark cherry and cassis. This is bold on the back side, with a resiny, oaky finish.",87,20,Mendoza Province
56940,Spain,"Aromas of fruit punch and wet dog are less than fulfilling. This feels weighty, with a flabby build and not much structure. Mushy berry flavors transition to raisin on a jammy, soft finish.",83,15,Northern Spain
56950,Spain,"Woodsy, spicy top aromas announce plenty of oak, which is confirmed by minty notes. In the mouth, this is raw and clamping—harsh in a word. Sour, pinchy, leafy flavors are herbal and underripe. A hard-tannin finish is grating.",81,26,Northern Spain
56960,France,"This wine is dense, although you hardly notice the tannins for the weight of concentrated fruit. The tannins are there, though, a power to thrust this immense wine well into the future. It is well formed, firm while rich. Drink from 2024.",96,530,Burgundy
56970,France,"The estate wine from Sacha Lichine's Ch?teau d'Esclans discloses deeper color than some rosés from Provence. It has a ripe feel, smooth red fruits and a touch of toastiness.

57000,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",88,19,Northern Spain
57010,Argentina,"Hot and crusty smelling at first blush and then the nose turns to mocha and smoky berry. Good mouthfeel, rich and balanced, with a fresh quality as well. Solid, complete red wine with a nice berry-packed Merlot character.",88,10,Mendoza Province
57020,US,"This is a thoroughly modern Cabernet. It could come from the Napa Valley floor, and is not particularly representative of Knights Valley. But it is flashy, with massively ripe blackberry, red currant, oak flavors, with oak providing a rich jacket of toast. So high in alcohol and soft, it seems unlikely to age, so drink up.",90,120,California
57030,US,"Still dry and tough in tannins at the age of four-plus years, this Cab shows the intense fruit of a mountain vineyard. It's power-packed in blackberries and cassis, with a firm, stony minerality that makes it feel hard. Drink over the next six years.",90,32,California

57050,Portugal,"From a very fine Port vineyard, this is an attractive wine from what is not a great Port vintage. It has perfumed fruits and gentle tannins that give a red fruit character to the wine. The wine is in a style that can almost be drunk young for its fruit, red plums and dried raisins spiced with acidity and a easy structure. Drink now, although for the true vintage Port experience, wait until 2025.",90,125,Port

57070,Italy,"Aromas and flavors of green apple and white peach come together on this lively, elegant white. Racy acidity lifts up the creamy flavors while a mineral vein ties it all together.",89,34,Northeastern Italy
57080,Spain,"Apple and stone fruit aromas are fresh and direct, not wayward, leesy or creamy. This is a layered, somewhat complex Albari?o, with fresh flavors of lemon curd and white peach. A dry, classy, wet stone finish is elegant and emphasizes the positives of the variety.",90,17,Galicia
57090,France,"This blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre shows considerable weight and richness for the price. Subtle garrigue shadings lead into dark flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cola and licorice, ending with hints of mocha and espresso. Drink it now??017.",90,15,Rh?ne Valley
57100,France,"This is the rare C?tes du Rh?ne that needs cellaring, but it is sourced from a patch of 50-year-old vines near Sorgues. Ground cinnamon and clove, fine leather and just enough cherry fruit mingle to create a compelling, medium-bodied wine framed by fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017??022, possibly beyond.",90,20,Rh?ne Valley
57110,US,"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, dried herbs, cranberry and black cherry lead to ripe but in focus pit-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of harmony. A squeeze of firm tannins provides the frame.",90,55,Washington
57120,US,"Grapefruit, peach and melon notes cannonball from nose to palate of this bright, intensely fruity wine. Zesty lemon-lime acidity keeps it vivacious and spry, but the finish is long, marked by gentle touches of honey and hibiscus nectar.",90,13,New York
57130,Italy,"Terra di Vulcano is a base line of wine from Bisceglia. The Agliancio del Vulture offers aromas of raspberry, strawberry, Indian spice and although the wine is big on ripe fruit flavors, it doesn't taste jammy or cooked.",86,,Southern Italy
57140,France,"The Barrel Selection certainly has no qualms about hiding its true colors. The nose offers ripe stone fruit supported by hints of butter and cream, while the mouth presents a prickly acidity and clean citrus flavors that prevent the wine from landing with a thud. A solid selection that will pair well with most poultry dishes.",86,13,Languedoc-Roussillon
57150,Germany,"This dainty off-dry Riesling is marked by aromas—ripe stone fruit and florals against a backdrop of tea leaves and crushed minerals. On the palate, it's intensely juicy, with flavors of orange, mango and peach, but with a streak of acidity that ripples the tongue.",91,23,Mosel

57190,France,"A very dry, tannic wine, full of dense structure. The fruit can be found underneath all this dryness, a layer of hedgerow blackberries, tight and firm. At the end, there is some baked acidity.",83,29,Bordeaux
57200,US,"There's a healthy 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc in this wine, which is classically structured in red fruit, soft oak and peppery spice. Its cedar notes speak to the Cab within, while the overall texture and breadth of the wine is lengthy, food-ready and impressive.",90,40,California
57210,US,"Brawny and concentrated in black fruit, this wine includes 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and is touted as a Cab-lover's Merlot by the winery. It indeed is, with its juicy blackberry, cherry, espresso and clove notes, while remaining varietally correct in terms of its mellowed tannins.",90,43,California
57220,US,"Spicy strawberry and cherry hover over forest floor and a tangle of tangy acidity that keeps this wine fresh and vibrantly compelling. Full bodied and robust, it maintains a balance in the glass, making it both food-friendly and an option on its own.",90,39,California

57250,US,"Merlot (59%) takes the lead on this blend, which is balanced out by Cabernet Franc. Intriguing aromas of herbs, flowers, spice raspberries, café au lait and barrel spices lead to silky, polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",90,35,Washington
57260,Argentina,"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.",83,13,Other
57270,US,"Dusty, tannic and simple. Still, juicy and pleasant enough, with a touch of bitterness on the finish.",83,11,California
57280,Germany,"Fresh green florals and melon rind lend a breathlessly cool tone to this elegantly composed dry Riesling. Forward flush yellow plum and gooseberry flavors are offset by lime zest, fresh sage and bristling acidity. It finishes with persistence and length. Drinks well now but should improve through 2020.",91,49,Rheinhessen
57290,Italy,"Aromas of dark berry, baking spice, Alpine herb, graphite, iris and a whiff of game take center stage.

57300,France,"The great 2010 vintage has produced an appropriately powerful and dense wine. With its tannins and concentrated, dry flavors, this wine is still young.

57310,US,"From the cooler Oak Knoll region of southern Napa, a wine with berry-cherry flavors and silky tannins. Yet it feels coarse and heavy, with a density and dullness Pinot Noir should not have. Suggests once again the unsuitability of Napa Valley for Pinot Noir.",84,26,California

57410,Spain,"Licorice and leather aromas give character to smoky yet generic plum and raspberry scents.

On the finish, things seem caught between racy and tired, so drink now.",88,22,Northern Spain

57540,Australia,"Most of this skin-fermented blend of 64% Semillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc spent four months in new oak.

57600,South Africa,"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. This is one well-balanced Cab, aged for 19 months in 75% new and 25% second fill French oak. It's warm and spicy upfront, leading with pleasant aromas of brambly berry compote, cassis, licorice root, charred tree bark and a touch of chocolate brownie. The palate is soft and smooth on entry, with rich, concentrated black-fruit flavors, but structured tannins pick up and lend serious grip to the long, spicy finish.

57650,US,"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros.",92,18,California
57660,France,"One of a pair of wines from this producer paying homage to neighboring regions, this wine references the Malbec of Cahors.

57850,US,"Having seen 20 months in French oak, the aromas of this wine are dominated by cola and rooibos tones.

59190,US,"This 100% Cabernet shows its pedigree in the refinement of its tannins and dryness, despite lush blackberry and cherry, currant, plum and oak flavors.

59940,France,"Ripe, full-bodied wine, the fresh white currant and pear fruits layered with wood. The wine is bright with good concentration. Screwcap.",88,23,Burgundy
59950,US,"The winery's just-released 2011 Cab is vigorous and good. Its tannins are a little rugged, with tongue-sticky astringency. Underneath that comes a burst of cherries, currants, plums and smoky oak. The wine doesn't feel like a long-term ager, but it does provide plenty of pleasure now and will hang in there until 2018??019.",90,42,California
59960,Germany,"Crushed mineral tones lend a smoky, dusty intensity to brilliantly ripe peach and mango flavors on this delicate off-dry Riesling. Bright with acidity and elegantly fruity, it's a fantastic bargain wine that should carry far beyond casual dining situations.",90,12,Mosel
59970,Italy,"Violet, iris, red berry and spice scents take center stage in this delicious blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot and Syrah. The bright, fruity palate delivers wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon spice notes alongside assertive tannins and freshness.",90,26,Tuscany
59980,US,"From an estate vineyard planted high atop the Sebastopol Hills near Freestone, this wine impresses from start to finish. It shows unique white pepper and floral aromas, while a seamless texture supports its succulent cranberry and cherry flavors, a long, lingering accent of nutmeg spice rounding out the finish.",95,60,California
59990,France,"The wine is powered both by its tannins and by its great fruit. Dark and dense both in the structure and the black-plum flavors, it is very fine wine??juicy and ripe. This is a serious wine with a great future. Drink from 2026.",95,55,Bordeaux
60000,France,"A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age. The pure, long and intense finish is a delicious promise. Drink 2017??037.",95,85,Alsace
60010,US,"This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best.",95,65,Oregon
60020,France,"Now at its peak, this impressive wine has moved from fruit to maturity, adding toastiness to its acidity and giving the wine richness. It's full and ripe while keeping the taut, steely edge proper to a Chardonnay Champagne. There's no need to age further. Drink now.",95,300,Champagne
60030,France,"A golden, liquorous wine, ripe honey and botrytis, yellow fruits and the most intense richness. The contrast is between the botrytis texture and crisp orange zest acidity that offers a beautifully balance wine for long-term aging.",93,55,Loire Valley
60040,France,"This is a dark purple colored wine, packed with tannins that come both from the rich fruit and new wood used in aging. It's still a young wine with black fruits showing strongly through the structure. Powerful and concentrated, it will age well over many years.",93,39,Southwest France
60050,France,"A powerfully concentrated wine, its ripe yellow fruits smoothly filling the mouth with their unctuous honeyed character. Ginger and other spices add an edge to this gorgeous, full wine that needs aging over many years.",93,45,Loire Valley
60060,Italy,"This opens with aromas of Spanish broom and wild berry. On the fresh easygoing palate, zesty acidity supports juicy red cherry and black raspberry. A nectarine note gives it a tangy close.",86,13,Southern Italy
60070,US,"Cedar and resin notes rise to the fore in this full-bodied wine that's basic and hearty, with blackberry and dried herb flavors.",86,70,California
60080,Portugal,"Perfumed and bright, this is an attractive blend that includes Pinot Noir and Syrah. With its ripe creamy texture and exuberant red fruits, the wine is ready to drink.",86,10,Lisboa
60090,US,"A yellowish shade of pink, this Grenache-based rosé shows Meyer lemons, tangerine zest and cantaloupe on the steely, restrained nose. There is lots of grippy texture on the palate, with mandarin orange rind, red-apple skin, light raspberry and lime juice-on-strawberry flavors.",89,20,California
60100,France,"A subdued nose leads to a very zesty palate, with grapefruit zest and crunchy green apple. The fruit is lively, clean and rather vivacious. Lemony freshness brightens the dry finish and makes you sip more.",89,23,Alsace
60110,Romania,"Made from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Feteasca Neagra, this wine has a bright nose of black cherry and dark plum with just a whiff of mint. Flavors of blackberry and plum are joined in the mouth by a sophisticated touch of tobacco leaf that recedes with the arrival of the zesty finish.",89,20,Panciu
60120,Italy,"Aromas of toast, coconut, oak and roasted coffee bean lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with a note of raw cherry and sage. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak-driven spice and the bracing, astringent tannins.",87,,Piedmont
60130,Italy,"This opens with aromas of toast, oak and roasted coffee bean that follow through to the tense palate of raw berry and powdered sage. Astringent tannins provide the framework.",87,,Piedmont
60140,US,"This is chewy and tannic, with sharp edges around cranberry fruit. It's blocky and one-dimensional, but solid and substantial. If Pinot Noir can ever be a steak wine, this is it. A touch of anise and coffee winds it down through the finish.",87,35,Oregon
60150,US,"Good in many respects, from the dryness and rich, intricate tannins to the pepper-accented black currant, chocolate and anise flavors. But there's a touch of overripe, Porty raisins, and the wine is too soft for ageability.",84,25,California
60160,Australia,Roast beef and black cherry notes open this juicy example from South Australia. Fresh but diffuse fruit notes dominate the crisp palate and lead to a cherry-flavored finish that lacks persistance. Drink now.,84,12,South Australia
60170,France,"A white currant-flavored wine with soft but fresh acidity, layered with just a touch of spice. The wine is fruity, juicy, an easy drink as an aperitif or with fish.",84,9,Southwest France
60180,US,Barrel notes of toast and spice intermingle with stone fruit aromas and flavors that show nuance. The flavors are light but the feel is compelling.,88,22,Washington
60190,US,"Whiffs of lavender and violet lend a perfumed, floral edge to this stylishly composed wine. Full bodied and supple on the palate, it's moderately concentrated with crisp blackberry and cherry flavors. Penetrating but fine-grained tannins bristle on the finish.",88,24,New York
60200,Italy,"This opens with aromas of toast, sage, hazelnut and a hint of eucalyptus. The palate offers sour cherry, strawberry jelly, anise and orange peel alongside assertive tannins that leave a dusty finish.",88,60,Piedmont
60210,US,"Made in a tart, juicy style, this well-structured Cabernet Sauvignon should be decanted. The acid-driven berry flavors carry a hint of gun metal. A few more years of bottle age would be advisable.",91,42,Washington
60220,US,"Made from fruit sourced from the well-known Paragon Vineyard, this 100% Albari?o is smooth and spicy, and its brilliant acidity highlights the green apple, citrus and vanilla flavors. Try this as an alternative to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.",91,24,California
60230,Italy,"Federico Primo is a consistent expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that doles out generous layers of plum and blackberry, backed by spicy tones of pipe tobacco and juniper. The oak-derived nuances add extra dimension and length to the finish.",91,40,Tuscany
60240,US,"Whiffs of black cherry, rose petal and spice scent this invigoratingly crisp red blend. It's satisfyingly full in body but impeccably balanced, offering taut black-cherry and plum flavors. Aged minimally in oak, there's not a lot of fuss or complication on the palate, but it's delightfully fresh and tasty. Drink now through 2019.",87,16,New York
60250,US,"Aromas of pear, apple, and whiffs of tropical fruit are followed by a tart lively palate full of rounded fruit flavors. It shows a light spritz and a lot of crispness.",87,15,Washington
60260,US,"This is a lightly tropical, peach-fuzzy wine, grassy with a touch of dried herb that gives it a meaty undertone. Lemon and grapefruit round out the experience, before a substantially dry, intense finish.",87,18,California
60270,Australia,"A relatively restrained, minerally version of Australian Chardonnay, with a touch of graphite to the crisp pear aromas. Some gently toasted nut notes impart richness of texture and complexity on the palate. Long and slightly tannic on the finish, this could develop well over the next 2?? years.",90,28,South Australia
60280,US,"There's a fine wine in here, but it needs a little time for those pesky tannins to soften. They coat the mouth with astringency, making it hard to appreciate the fruit. But the fruit is there, in the form of pure, sweet cherries. It's not a longterm ager, but a year or three in the cellar should make this soft, gentle wine more beautiful.",90,60,California
60290,US,"Buena Vista's been trying hard to get this cool-climate, single-vineyard wine right, and they've been succeeding inch by inch in building in layers of complexity. The '05 is rich and ripe in blackberry, pepper and new oak flavors, and is very dry and tannic. It will benefit from 3?? years in the cellar.",90,37,California
60300,US,"Aromas of milk chocolate, herb, plum and cherry are followed by a palate full of cherry and chocolate flavors that persist on the finish. The tannins bring astringency that provides some distraction.",86,12,Oregon
60310,Australia,"Scents of singed orange peel, roasted nuts and lemon curd are promising, but are followed up by rather crisp, ungenerous lemon flavors. There's a silky textural element on the palate and a long finish, so it may yet come around.",86,35,Victoria
60320,US,"Robust in red berry and vanilla, this wine is big-boned and ripe, with a tartness under lying the fruit and a moderate structure.",86,32,California
60330,US,"Your first sniff of this wine reveals gooseberry notes, an impression confirmed when you taste it. It's bone dry, and that green, herbal flavor is relieved by riper lemons, limes and mangoes. It's a severe wine, dry and acidic, but deserves credit for elegance and varietal purity.",89,49,California
60340,US,"Like a liquid blueberry cobbler, this is a juicy, soft, well-integrated red wine, leathery and roundly rich. Perfect for a rib roast meal with buttery mashed potatoes, let it breathe a half-hour or two before serving.",89,32,California
60350,Italy,"Aromas recall meat juices, toasted oak, berries, espresso and cooking spices. The palate serves up wild cherry accented with cinnamon, sage, thyme, coffee and oak alongside just enough fresh acidity and assertive tannins. Drink 2015??021.",89,,Tuscany

60370,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is full-bodied and spicy. A good, sound wine for drinking now.",84,30,California
60380,US,"Marginally riper and plusher than Rusack's other two Pinots, but not by a lot. This is still a lean, earthy wine, short on flavor and long on acidity and tannins. Sift through the herbal, bay leaf and sage tastes and you'll find a note of cherry. Aging may help.",86,32,California
60390,Italy,"A fresh, ripe style of wine, with spice and roundness. It has crisp citrus flavors to give it a lively aftertaste.",86,,Northeastern Italy
60400,US,"Simple and jammy, although tasty enough, with lip-smacking, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and spicy mocha. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with gentle acids and tannins.",86,38,California
60410,US,"Good, rich Napa Cabernet in this bottle, packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and cedar flavors. The wine shows a firm, full-bodied texture. Best now and through 2010.",88,55,California
60420,US,"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, which the Parker family sold a few years ago, comes this tough, acidic young wine. It shows a maritime influence in the dry tartness and bitter cherryskin flavors. Could be a sleeper.",88,58,California
60430,France,"The wine has a hard extracted edge, with bitter tannins that are dominating the fruitiness. It needs to soften and bring out the berry fruits, although the wine will always have a tough character.",86,16,Bordeaux
60440,Chile,"Medicinal cherry aromas are a touch herbal and green, but also floral. This red-tinted Malbec is jammy on the palate, with lightly herbal plum and currant flavors. The zesty finish brings a cool-vintage green character into play.",86,16,Cachapoal Valley
60450,US,"Yet another extreme barrel-aged wine from Core Wine Co. Cherry syrup and heavy wood presence on the nose is followed by dark chocolate, cooked vanilla and other flavors dominated by wood and age.",86,25,California
60460,US,"A healthy percentage of Sauvignon Musque sets the tone for this creamy and somewhat spicy white wine, a mix of vanilla and unctuous fig that finds a balance with flavors of crisp, green apple and melon. Fresh acidity keeps the fullness of the wine in check.",88,18,California
60470,US,"Equal parts Viognier and Roussanne, this offers aromas of ripe peach and flowers that lead to dry, full-bodied flavors that taper toward the finish.",88,20,Washington
60480,US,"Lots of smoky, toasted-oak aromas and tight, dark fruit flavors meet a firm and very tannic texture and dry mouthfeel in this full-bodied wine. Too intense to enjoy now, this will need until at least 2018 to turn more smooth and drinkable.",88,21,California
60490,France,"The wine is smoky, with black currant-fruits and a core of dry tannins. Those tannins are probably not going anywhere much, so while the fruit and acidity will soften, the wine will always be dry.",84,19,Bordeaux
60500,Spain,"An odd mix of apricot, melon, oak spice and herbaceousness leads to a chunky palate with green flavors and forceful woody notes. A flat, pickled-tasting finish fails to bring this around.",84,40,Northern Spain
60510,France,"This wine has soft apple and ripe pear flavors. It has a smooth texture that means it is ready to drink. The aftertaste, with its crisper acidity, suggests a wine that will be a good apéritif.",84,10,Bordeaux
60520,Italy,"This offers mature black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. The palate is ripe yet firm, delivering prune, mocha and clove clove flavors blanketed in chewy tannins. Drink 2018??023.",89,48,Tuscany
60530,Italy,"Leather, truffle, ripe berry and a whiff of oak-derived spice lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese wine. The taut palate delivers mature plum, black cherry and licorice flavors, its fine-grained tannins leaving a firm, dry finish.",89,34,Tuscany
60540,US,"This mixes darker shades of berry and cherry fruit, with a streak of tobacco and well-managed tannins. It's polished and carries moderate weight through the finish.",89,65,Oregon
60550,Spain,"Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.",89,30,Northern Spain
60560,France,"A fresh, citrus-dominated wine, with really crisp, lively fruit. The floral aromas are followed by a zingy character and a white fruit aftertaste. Screwcap.",88,,Bordeaux
60570,Spain,"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis. The palate is rich and relaxed, with blackberry, plum and lightly oaked vanilla flavors. It's integrated and smooth, with a touch of wood and caramel well woven into the wine's core fabric. Drink now.",88,14,Northern Spain
60580,France,"While the wine is dry from the austere tannins, it also has a core of ripe berry fruits that are laced with acidity. It should develop some more and the tannins will soften, although they will always be very present. Drink from early 2018.",88,23,Provence
60590,US,"In this blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, vanilla, carob, herb, green wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by fruit and oak-derived flavors in equal proportion. It shows restraint but doesn't come together.",88,60,Washington
60600,France,"Crisp and bright, this wine has retained plenty of acidity even in this ripe vintage. Attractive and spicy, it offers citrus fruits as well as apricots. Drink now.",88,30,Burgundy

60620,Italy,"I Papiri is a fresh and fragrant white, with bright aromas of citrus, cut grass and white peach. Pair it with any Mediterranean fish dish.",87,15,Sicily & Sardinia

60640,Chile,"This opens with aromas of blackberry, cassis and leather. The palate is full and fairly lush, with firm, rubbery tannins. Ripe, leathery blackberry and chocolate flavors finish long and with modest tannin-driven clamp.",89,14,Colchagua Valley
60650,Chile,"Meaty, earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits show a fair amount of wood. The palate is ripe and blocky, with black-fruit flavors, primarily blackberry and plum, accented by a noticeable herbal element. Toasty and spicy on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced Carmenère.",89,11,Cachapoal Valley
60660,US,"Baked pineapple and mango rise to the fore in this nutty, slightly grassy and herbal wine. It's lightly bodied and creamy in texture.",86,20,California
60670,France,"This is a bright, cherry-flavored wine. It has an attractive tannic edge to the ready-to-drink fruitiness. The acidity at the end gives the wine a good lift.",86,12,Beaujolais
60680,US,"This wine brings obvious fruit flavor that is ripe to overripe, good acidity and a nicely gripping texture. It tastes a bit earthy and woody and seems to be plenty mature.",86,36,California
60690,Italy,"Aromas of woodland berry, toast, clove and chopped herb emerge in the glass. The palate is still rather closed, eventually giving up raw red berry, coconut, espresso, oak and grilled sage alongside tightly wound, astringent tannins. Give this a few more years to open up. Drink 2018??024.",89,60,Piedmont
60700,US,"This gutsy blend of two-thirds Zinfandel plus Syrah and Tempranillo has a deep color, fresh spicy oak aromas, vivid fruit flavors and a lip-smacking layer of fine tannin. It should be just the thing with a grilled steak or pulled pork.",89,,California
60710,Spain,"Light fleshy aromas of peach and apricot lead to a tight juicy direct palate with pure, unadulterated flavors of pineapple, tangerine and apple. A crisp stony finish is fresh and in fine shape. This is a textbook racy Albari?o to drink right away.",89,18,Galicia
60720,France,Red fruits and banana aromas lead to a wine that has a lightly tannic touch over bright cherry fruits. Intense acidity and a herbaceous character come from grapes that are barely ripe. Drink now.,84,,Beaujolais
60730,Spain,"Yellow in color, this blend of 80% Macabeo and 20% Sauvignon Blanc smells waxy, with notes of lanolin, peach and papaya. It's sharp and fairly austere on the tongue, with tart, lemony flavors that end pithy, citric and slightly bitter. Drink immediately.",84,10,Levante
60740,US,"This medium-bodied wine is dry and crisp, showing light dried herb, celery and nut aromas. Lively citrus flavors are tinged with earthiness and a tangy texture.",83,30,California
60750,Australia,"This wine may lack the dramatic power of its top-flight brethren, but it still satisfies, delivering reasonably complex notes of cherries, rhubarb and olive carried by silky tannins and moderate alcohol. Drink this terrific value over the next year or two.",89,12,South Australia
60760,Spain,"A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age.",89,102,Northern Spain
60770,Spain,"Opens with grainy, whispy aromas of reedy raspberry and smoky blackberry. Feels tannic and aggressive, so it punches ahead with lively, firm flavors of raspberry, plum and strawberry. Finishes oaky, with vanilla and dill notes. Bold Rioja to drink now.",88,20,Northern Spain
60780,Portugal,"Initially fresh, with a creamy, white-fruit texture, this has acidity, but it finishes fat and rather hot, with pepper.",83,9,Alentejo
60790,US,"After three-plus years in the bottle, this Grenache is still a bit sharp. But it's a delicious, interesting wine with all sorts of berry, cherry, currant, grilled meat, tobacco and sandalwood flavors. An inaugural release from this winery, which has been selling their fruit to other wineries for years.",88,40,California
60800,Italy,"This is a unique wine indeed. The style here is heavy, thick and shows the limits Pinot Grigio can achieve in terms of extraction and richness. The wine's appearance shows a copperish hue and the texture is thickly laced with carmel, candied fruit and apricot.",88,17,Northeastern Italy
60810,France,"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017.",87,25,Bordeaux
60820,Italy,"Leafy underbrush, fennel, hay, savory herb and dried berry aromas come together in the glass. The palate lacks fruit richness but offers raw red berry, espresso, dried sage and anisette alongside astringent tannins.",87,72,Tuscany
60830,Italy,"Aromas suggest toast, mocha, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of burnt matches. The oak-driven spices carry over to the palate along with a licorice note but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins provide the backbone.",87,50,Tuscany
60840,France,"90??2. Barrel sample. This ripe and chocolatey wine is soft and pleasantly characteristic of Merlot. Full-bodied and rich, the palate is touched by spice and topped with attractive acidity. There's a rich feel to it all around.",91,,Bordeaux
60850,France,"88??0. Barrel sample. Juicy and fruity, this wine is a classic example of the vintage. Along with a forward fruit character, there is a spicy element from new wood. The wine finishes with layered acidity.",89,,Bordeaux
60860,US,"There's a reason few wineries nowadays produce Barbera. It's a boring wine, and just because it comes from as fine a producer as Reverie can't change that fact. The wine is dry, tannic and dull, with unevenly ripened flavors.",82,50,California
60870,Italy,"This strange wine opens with a bright gold, almost amber color and a surprisingly neutral nose. There's nothing wrong with the wine, in fact in the mouth, it leaves resiny aromas of butterscotch, exotic fruit and candied banana.",81,,Southern Italy
60880,Italy,"This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful.",99,440,Piedmont
60890,Argentina,"Packed and concentrated, with blueberry, blackberry, bramble and pastry aromas. Initially, it's jumbled and out of joint, with jumpy acids and heavy flavors of blackberry, grilled meat and herbs, while on the finish, the fruit fades quickly, leaving weight, resin and vanilla.",89,55,Mendoza Province
60900,US,"Made in a bone dry, acidic style, what this Chardonnay lacks in richness it makes up for in elegance. Fans of sweet, buttery Chards won't like it, but true aficionados will appreciate the austere citrus and mineral flavors.",89,21,California
60910,Italy,"This Brunello shows elegant aromatic restraint in its tight aromas of wild berry and red currant. Dark flavors of barbecue spice, cured meat, leather and tobacco layer the midpalate, then turn fine and full on the finish.",89,80,Tuscany
60920,US,"Serious Cabernet, rich and complex and full bodied, made from Knights Valley and Alexander Valley fruit, with a few grapes from Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder. Dense and tannic now, but high toned, with waves of black currants, black cherries and oak. A good price for a Cabernet of this quality. Drink now??012.",91,30,California
60930,France,"The dry, hard tannins are very Saint-Estèphe, but the wine bears its weight well, giving good black plum and berry fruits and a dense texture. It has a solid, chunky feel to it, dark and firm. The finish is more fresh and juicy.",91,,Bordeaux
60940,France,"Caramel and vanilla aromas, the palate rounded, poised, with pear and green plum flavors, along with lively acidity, filled out with toast.",93,95,Burgundy
60950,US,"This block-grown Pinot from the estate vineyard, in the heart of the cool Green Valley, shows the signature Marimar style of tight acidity, dryness, silky elegance and red fruit. It's not a big, fat, blockbuster Pinot, but a leaner, more masculine style. The raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors should hold up well to the aging process. Now??013, at least.",93,47,California
60960,Australia,"A blend of Shiraz from Eden Valley and the valley floor, this is both amply endowed and impressively complex. The creamy purée of raspberries is dusted with peppery spice and cocoa, leaving a savory impression on the lasting finish. Drink now??015.",93,50,South Australia

60990,Italy,"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this easy-drinking wine opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flower, graphite and whiffs of exotic spice.

61000,Spain,"Red-fruit aromas of currant and raspberry aren't sophisticated but they are good and fruity. Firm and solidly built, this likeable, easy-drinking blend offers plum, blackberry and raspberry flavors along with a loamy finish that contains a ripe hint of raisin.",87,15,Levante
61010,US,"If you're looking for a decent everyday Chardonnay at an inexpensive price, consider this one. It's dry and creamy in texture, with slightly sweet, oaky tangerine and pineapple flavors.",84,7,California
61020,US,"Subtly nutty on the nose with a hint of lemony perfume, this Chardonnay sparkler is pleasantly brisk but a little dilute on the palate. Small bubbles are soft and gently mouthfilling.",84,11,New York
61030,US,"A sound, rather generic red wine, medium- to full-bodied, with sleek tannins framing jammy cherry and raspberry flavors. Pretty good for the price, and easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",84,10,California
61040,Austria,"The vanilla spice and smokiness of new oak dominates the nose, the palate however is subtle and smooth where dark berry fruit is edged by smoky spice.

61050,Italy,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, wild mint, dill, coffee and tobacco emerge on this full-bodied red.

61060,Austria,"Wonderfully concentrated and aromatic blueberry mixes with floral overtones of violet and smoky vanilla oak on nose and palate. The body is smooth but has a rather warm finish.

61070,US,"A bit sharp, but polished and supple, with good varietal flavors of blackberries, currants, tobacco and a hint of heady crême de cassis liqueur. Seems at its best now, so drink up.",88,24,California
61080,Italy,"Despite its obvious pedigree (Cannubi may be Barolo's most famous cru site), this Riserva lacks some of the depth and complexity you can expect from this vineyard. The 2005 vintage has pushed up the alcohol, but otherwise the wine is marked by berry, violet and cola aromas.",88,,Piedmont

It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",87,12,Catalonia

61320,Portugal,"The Jaen in Portugal is unique to the D?o (in Spain it is called Mencía). It gives, as in this wood-aged wine, a richly tannic character, full of red-berry fruits. The wood aging creates the hint of toast that is still present. Drink from 2018.",88,35,D?o
61330,US,"Dark plum fruit shows on the nose of this bottling from a quality-focused property in the region, with touches of smoked meat and dried herbs adding complexity.

61400,US,"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate.

61490,US,"As with the Indian Wells Cabernet, winemaker Bob Bertheau is using a considerable amount of Syrah (19%) to beef up the flavors. The Merlot here seems a bit light, it fades out in midpalate. There is a chalkiness to the finish, and the tannins are just a little green.",85,18,Washington
61500,US,"This is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.",85,8,Washington

61610,Spain,"Concentrated, potent aromas of earthy blackberry and cassis bring notes of briar patch, prune and exotic spices.

61630,Spain,"Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit.

Drink now through 2014.",91,68,Catalonia
61640,Italy,"Licorice, ripe fruit, ginger, lemon zest, crushed stone, cassis and wild berry notes are bold, but in the mouth the wine is lean and compact, with a particularly bright and fresh feel in the mouth. There's even a menthol note at the very end.",91,49,Tuscany

61920,US,"Super-tannic, one of those dry Napa red wines that makes you wonder why you opened it now.

62310,Germany,"Pristine peach and grapefruit flavors contrast with slightly stinky but captivating soil and saffron complexities in this sprightly auslese.

Drink through 2019.",91,32,Northern Spain
62780,Austria,"Red cherry fruit spiced by gentle white pepper notes makes for an enjoyable, fresh and joyful red.

If you are new to Austrian reds, this pretty much is exquisite Burgenland in a glass.",93,36,Burgenland
62790,Austria,"Pure and soaring elderberry fruit with overtones of Morello cherry puts this in the darker fruit spectrum. Nonetheless, it has all the freshness and verve of red-fruited styles.

64560,US,"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",87,22,Washington
64570,US,"Very rich and fruit-forward in currants, cola, cedar and figs, with an exotic complexity suggesting dried dates and figs. Delicious, but a bit full-bodied and heavy. Could develop.",87,50,California

64640,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",84,15,Galicia
64650,US,"Will satisfy Chardophiles with its oaky, creamy flavors and notes of pineapples, lemons and limes. Finishes dry and crisp in acidity.",83,10,California

64710,Portugal,"Blending Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this lightly wood-aged wine is rich, stylish and full of young fruit flavors.

64740,US,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors.

64780,Spain,"Aromas of lanolin, wet wool and squash indicate that this wine has lost much of its fruit. That's confirmed on the palate, which feels tired and thin, with fading stone-fruit flavors. The wine is nearing the end of its drinking enjoyment.",87,25,Galicia

64860,France,"The tannins are already finely integrated into the rich, ripe fruit. It has a smoky character along with a note of wood spice, and the black plum fruit serves as a juicy underlay. Given its weight and structure, this should for age five years at least.",91,72,Burgundy
64870,US,"Tough and gritty now, due to a combination of hard skin and seed tannins and unintegrated new oak. The intensely concentrated blackberry fruit has a slight edge of raisiny overripeness that adds to the sweet, fruity richness. Seems perfectly capable of aging for many years. Try after 2012.",91,80,California

64920,Italy,"Stewed prune, scorched earth, leather, menthol and leafy underbrush aromas set the tone.

Give the tannins another year or two to unfold but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",88,95,Tuscany
64930,US,"This wine has a vivid spicy, oaky aroma and the same powerful woody character dominates the flavors. It also has full body and enough blackberry flavors to complete a tasty picture, along with a very reasonable price tag.",88,13,California
64940,Argentina,"Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.",83,13,Mendoza Province
64950,Argentina,"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.",83,16,Other

65020,US,"Tasted in Feb., 2009, this Cab still showed a lot of fresh, piquant primary fruit character. The jammy cherries and blackberries are brightened with crisp, citrusy acidity. Clean and balanced, but a bit rude now. Needs a couple years to knit together.",88,60,California
65030,South Africa,"This solid Merlot begins with savory aromas of cloves, black cherry, and smoke, leading into like flavors in a structured, spirited package. The wine could continue to age, but makes for a good sip now. Pair with smoked meats, roasted duck.",87,13,Paarl
65040,US,"The winery seems to be calling this Shiraz, not Syrah, because of the wine's direct simplicity, in the Aussie style. It's a soft, fruity wine, bigtime in cherries and blackberries, made to be immediately drinkable.",86,28,California
65050,France,"Almonds and a strongly yeasty element are the main characters of this sparkling wine. It's full, but the fruit still has a texture to it, leaving good acidity to finish. Good value, enjoyable wine.",86,10,France Other

65070,Spain,Dry apple and pine-needle aromas are punchy on this blend of 80% Grenache Blanc and 20% Macabeo. An uneventful palate is fresh but simple. This wine tastes mostly of bitter grape skins and almond skins. Modest apple and grapefruit notes show on the finish.,86,27,Catalonia

65090,US,"Intense aromas of pressed blackberries and blueberries show on the nose of this dessert wine that leans way more fresh than pruney. The palate is loaded with rich, full flavors of fudge, blueberry jam and a long-lasting licorice note. Strong acidity and judicious alcohol give it structural backbone, and makes it the perfect foil for an end-of-night cigar.",91,39,California
65100,US,"All Syrah, this pale copper-colored wine offers very pretty aromas of watermelon, pear and cherry. The palate is elegantly styled, dry, fresh and vibrant with spritely acidity and a drawn-out, citrus-filled finish.",91,23,Washington
65110,France,"Produced from a selection of 80-year-old vines, this is a dense, smooth wine. It has a dry core although this is surrounded by such rich fruit and spice. The wine is now almost mature, ripe and full with a great shot of final acidity.",91,67,Bordeaux

65150,Argentina,"Jammy, stewy berry aromas are accented by brick dust and sweet oak that smells like plastic. Saturated, jammy and clumsy in feel, this tastes of baked, peppery black fruits and oak. Finishing notes of chocolate, herbs and licorice are chunky and a touch hot.",85,19,Mendoza Province
65160,Portugal,"One of the better examples in this category, this is crisp and clean. It has a hint of tannin and a green edge from the only just-ripe grapes. The strawberry flavor at the end does bring an attractive aftertaste.",85,9,Vinho Verde
65170,Argentina,"Crisp, minerally aromas are low on fruit. Zesty, lively and citric on the palate, this tastes lean, linear and sharp, with orange notes and a salty aftertaste. A briny tasting, tangy finish fits the bill.",85,15,Mendoza Province
65180,US,"Coconut oil, lime blossoms, fermenting citrus, kaffir lime and cold steel aromas show on the nose of this bottling of a grape rarely planted on the Central Coast.

65330,US,"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G.",88,10,Idaho

66030,Portugal,"With its big, fat mouthfeel, but very little fruit to back it up, at this stage this wine seems to be about wood, spice and richness without balance. The Reserva from the property seems to have a better focus.",85,32,D?o

66190,US,"The high alcohol (15.5%) and pruney character suggests that this was picked late—a bit too late to retain any elegance. The acids are sharp and citric and not well integrated, leaving the fruit almost invisible.

This dry wine is ready to drink.",91,53,Champagne
66260,Portugal,"This is the best vintage of Delaforce table wine so far. It has weight, density, great red fruits and a final freshness. A ripe wine, with some spice and hints of wood aging, it is ready to drink but can be enjoyed until 2020.",88,10,Douro

66300,Italy,"Subdued aromas of dried berry, toasted oak and scorched earth eventually emerge in the glass.

The fruit is starting to dry up, so don't hold on to this too long.",87,53,Tuscany
66310,US,"Rose-petal aromas and green-apple flavors bring a distinct personality to this light-bodied, snappy-tasting wine. While the first impression is floral and openly fruity, an underlying crisp acidity comes through on the finish and keeps it refreshing.",87,18,California

66380,Italy,"If you prefer older-style Brunello with its firm tannins and solid backbone of dry fruit, then this is the one for you.

The wine is soft around the edges and showing signs of early oxidation, so drink soon.",88,30,Oregon
66450,US,"Light red-fruit flavors are spiced up beautifully with cinnamon and sweet toast. This is an elegant, peppery wine that's well defined and still showing some youthful sharpness. It will reward additional bottle age and should cellar well for up to a decade.",90,45,Washington

66810,Italy,"Made of 85% Sangiovese and small amounts of Ciliegiolo and Canaiolo, this opens with subtle Morello cherry and underbrush aromas. The palate delivers black plum and tobacco flavors, bolstered by dusty tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,17,Tuscany
66820,Spain,"Heavily herbal spicy leafy aromas are green like cool-climate Cab Franc, and then a massive bolt of oaky char takes over. This Cabernet Sauvignon is hard, drying and tough on the palate. Herbal roasted black-fruit flavors are smothered in burnt oak, while this is blackened but green tasting on the finish. Ripeness of fruit was clearly an issue in this cool vintage.",87,100,Northern Spain
66830,Spain,"Aromas of jammy berry fruits, licorice gum drop and warm earth are scattershot and precede a palate that's chunky but flat in feel. Buttery oaky berry and raisin flavors are solid but not direct or focused on the finish.",87,15,Northern Spain
66840,France,"Sprightly, fresh Mirabelle plum mixes with headier notes of rose to present a full-fruited but fresh array of juicy, sweet pear, more plum, mandarin and tangerine. The mouthfeel has that typical Gewurztraminer oily richness but also a welcome slick of 2014 acidity.",89,22,Alsace

66930,US,"This wine is made from the same barrels as the producer's Finch Hollow offering, using the wine from the top of the barrels and left unfined and unfiltered.

66950,US,"Aromas of ripe red cherries, licorice and vanilla extract emerge from this wine by the longtime estate across from the township of Santa Ynez.

66960,US,"Fresh apple aromas and lively citrus flavors make a good combination in this light-bodied, tangy-textured wine.

Keep for 10 years or more.",93,55,Southern Italy
67020,France,"Jaboulet has been investing heavily in recent years, and the terrific 2009 Terre Ferme is one of the payoffs. It's meaty and plummy on the nose, with an expansive, plush mouthfeel.

67060,US,"Very ripe and fruity in the modern style, almost too strong in blackberry jam, black currant and oak flavors that are not particularly subtle or delicate, although the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are significant, but negotiable. The suggestion is ageability. Give it 2?? years and try again.",88,45,California

67090,France,"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.",94,70,Bordeaux
67100,US,"The most balanced of Sea Smoke's three new Pinots, Southing was aged in about two-thirds new oak, which gives rich caramel, toasted coconut and exotic spice notes to the ripe fruit flavors. The wine explodes with cherries, raspberries, mulberries and even chocolate mint, finishing long and spicy, and leaving the impression of wholesomeness and completeness. Now showing its peak of youthful vivacity, this should develop for an additional six years.",95,50,California
67110,US,"Slightly muted tones of black cherry and plum preserves are accented by wet soil, mushroom and coconut in this rustic yet elegant Cabernet Franc.

67130,US,"This 70-30 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah brings fruit-filled aromas of plum, herb and cherry. It packs a mouthful of fruit flavors, with firm lightly astringent tannins providing support. It needs some time to stretch its legs.",88,14,Washington
67140,Italy,"Intense violet, red-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas set the stage in this bright red. The lively palate delivers red cherry, blackberry and cinnamon touches alongside round tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy soon.",88,15,Piedmont
67150,US,"Extremely woody aromas of cedar meet with prunes, tobacco leaf and nutmeg on the nose of this bottling from a property south of San Jose.

67160,France,"This is a ripe, fruity wine from a village that also has vines in the Pouilly Fuissé appellation. Soft and rounded, it conveys apricot and melon flavors that are shot through with acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.",88,19,Burgundy

67180,US,"Dark and brooding, this Cuvée of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec opens with spicy acidity before it delves into mouthcoating layers of mocha and black licorice. Nearly black in color and definitely full bodied, it finishes with length and a strong seasoning of cinnamon.",92,65,California
67190,US,"The less expensive of the winery's two Pinot Gris, this is in some respects the better wine. Excellent focus pulls crisp flavors of pear, lemon curd and flinty mineral into sharp resolution, and appealing minerality gives the acidity a resonant texture. It all resolves in a lovely, creamy finish.",92,20,Oregon
67200,Portugal,"The full juiciness of Castel?o is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016.",90,15,Península de Setúbal
67210,Portugal,"Solid and structured, this is a rich, darkly tannic wine. It's not all structure, with the ripe black plum and berry fruits giving weight to the palate and smoothing the structure. The end is spicy, tannic, dense and worth aging. Drink from 2015.",90,,Alentejano
67220,France,"The steep slope of Beauroy produces ripe grapes, but also wines that maintain intense minerality and structure. The Chablis is tight, nervy, and still young, but exhibits bright lemon and peach flavors touched with honey. Cellar this serious wine, and drink from 2015.",90,,Burgundy
67230,US,"A lightly spicy wine, this mixes rather thin red-currant and raspberry flavors. It's pleasantly juicy, clean and fruity, with a quickly fading finish.",87,30,Oregon
67240,Spain,"Neutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.",87,20,Catalonia

67290,US,"Dried strawberries, wild berries, cloves cinnamon and cocoa powder power the nose on this bottling from a vineyard named after a famous composer who once owned the property.

67300,Italy,"A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas of underbrush, cedar, bluish-black fruit, spice and a whiff of scorched earth.

67310,Spain,"Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors.

67320,US,"This affordable, straightforward white wine is fresh and crisp, buoyed up with tart acids and flavors of citrus rind, pears, and green apples.

67340,Italy,"Aromas of stewed fruit, leather, tilled soil and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The austere palate shows bright red berry, ground white pepper and menthol alongside chewy tannins and brisk acidity. It has the breeding to evolve and improve through 2025 or so.",89,80,Tuscany
67350,France,"Rich, juicy and structured, this firm wine has great power and concentration along with a dark, dry core. It's almost too much of a good thing, very flamboyant and ripe. It still needs to age to be fully balanced.",89,28,Bordeaux
67360,US,"The 2011 vintage was challenging for Washington in general and for the Walla Walla Valley in particular. This wine puts that aside with notes of dried cranberries and cherries along with vanilla and dry chocolate accents. The tart fruit flavors are elegant, with dry, grainy tannins along with vanilla flavors that carry through on the finish.",89,38,Washington
67370,France,"Earthy and truffley in an attractive and complex way, this fairly mature offering has a full mouthfeel and rich apple and plum flavors. The long finish brings tart plums.

67380,US,"From the Muscat Canelli grape; it’s a very sweet (10.8% residual sugar) wine balanced by quite high acidity. Aromas and flavors are distinctly apricot and buttercream.

67430,France,"89-91 Barrel sample. Juicy, the fruit showing some awkward super-maturity. Power, but the structure is missing.",90,,Bordeaux
67440,France,"Top of the range from Eugénie, this pure Malbec is huge, firm and very concentrated. Wood aging has added spice and emphasized the dryness that comes from the fruit and wood tannins.

67490,US,"This is an eclectic collection of white Rh?ne varieties, beginning with equal parts Roussanne and Viognier, supported by Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc and Marsanne. A combination of honey and dried apricot are the standouts, aligned with a lilt of fresh peach and salty caramel.",88,28,California
67500,US,"This is the winery's low production barrel selection reserve. It shows big, zingy acidity and spicy, jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, and is totally dry. The alcohol is refreshingly low. Tastes a bit direct now. Give it until early 2011 to calm down.",87,55,California
67510,US,"A little soft in texture, but interesting for its mosaic of blackberry, pepper, smoked meat, currant and balsam flavors, and the way the firm tannins provide structure. This bone-dry, big-boned Syrah was grown in the San Bernabe Vineyard of the southern Salinas Valley.",87,25,California
67520,US,"Here's a soft, high alcohol, slightly hot Zin, lacking in acidity. What it lacks in structure, it more than makes up for in sheer, exuberant taste.

67530,Portugal,"An intense wine. it has a cool feel from its 900-foot-high vineyards. Plenty of acidity keeps it fresh and fruity, bringing out flavors of black currant as well as spicy wood. It could age a year, so wait until 2015.",87,11,Douro
67540,US,"This is the flagship Chardonnay from Thomas Fogarty Winery, a one-barrel lot that comes from a third-acre vineyard. And yet, from the winery's excellent 2011 line-up, it brings the least to the table. A zesty, grassy lemon-lime soda nose lands on the palate with Key lime and very little complication, making it pleasurable, but fairly breezy for the headiest of the Fogarty lot. Pair with halibut or seared scallops.",87,75,California
67550,Chile,"Spicy and dry on the nose, with red cherry, plum and candied sweetness. The palate has good body and feel, with medicinal plum and berry flavors along with an olive accent. Juicy and forward, with a lightly herbal finish.",86,10,Maipo Valley

67640,US,"A lengthy, plush and full-bodied expression of the variety, this wine is sourced from the producer's estate, Stanly Ranch, as well as Hyde and Poe vineyards.

67750,Argentina,"Herbal, jammy aromas of raspberry and plum are spicy but reedy. This feels a bit heavy and out of shape.

68660,US,"Bold and flavorful without feeling overtly ripe or sweet, this wine has a lot to say. It's complex and spicy, smelling of cardamom, nutmeg and rosemary—a possible result of its 25% whole-cluster fermentation.

72400,US,"Bone dry and tart in acidity, both of which are nice, with mouthwatering lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. Would be better if not for some green feline notes that are almost sour.",85,15,California
72410,US,"Good and dry, but awkward, with slightly vegetal flavors sticking through riper ones of blackberries and black currants. The acid-tannin relationship also is unbalanced. Redeems itself on the finish, with a flourish of chocolate.",84,65,California

72430,Georgia,"Notes of bright, candied red cherries, cedar and spice fill the nose and palate of this full bodied blend of Saperavi and Merlot from Georgia. The bright acidity makes for a fresh sip, but harsh tannins lead to a choppy, jagged finish.",84,17,Kakheti

72510,US,"The wine is dark and tannic, and while it has a huge core of black cherries, the balance is off, suggesting that it won't age well. The alcohol feels hot and porty, with a chocolate-covered raisin finish. Drink up.",86,65,California

It's the baby brother of Dominus, offering a look at the style of the estate without the price tag of the flagship offering.",90,30,California
72620,US,"Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components.",90,120,California
72630,US,"A bouquet of dark red fruits and heavy cedar accents opens this even, well-balanced offering. Looks and tastes mature; the dry, cherry-chocolate flavors are forward, and it closes with handsome tobacco and cedar notes. Appealing and ready to go. Drink now to 2004.",90,75,California

72720,US,"Seven Hills and Les Collines provide the grapes for this 80-20 Cab-Merlot blend. The cool 2011 vintage was especially noticeable in Walla Walla—here expressed as light strawberry and cranberry fruit, caught in a shell of acid.

72730,US,"Sourced from all over the Napa Valley, this wine blends 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 1% Syrah and other unnamed red varieties.

72740,Austria,"Still closed, this emanates earthy notes at first while the palate shows pink grapefruit zest hugged by very ripe, lemon-toned peach with tropical overtones of fresh and canned pineapple.

72750,US,"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically.

72780,US,"With its keen acidity and mineral-dominated flavors, this currently tastes a bit austere. It also has a core of orange, apricot and mango flavors that are sweetened by oak. Don't drink it too cold, and allow it to breathe before consuming.",88,31,California

72820,US,"The barrel influence is heavy on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coconut out front of the variety's red fruit. Still, the silky feel and spice flavors bring plenty of appeal; it's just a bit hard to get at the fruit.",89,36,Washington
72830,Chile,"Rich, oaky aromas of coconut and vanilla are matched by earthy, almost nutty berry and cassis scents. This is tannic, grabby and slightly abrasive, while chocolate, cherry and cassis flavors end long, strong and ripe. Drink through 2018.",89,30,Maipo Valley
72840,Spain,"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of stewed berry, coffee grinds and compost are less than appealing, although with airing things improve. This is wide and blocky in the mouth, with ripe, raisiny, roasted black-fruit flavors matched by bitter espresso. Molasses and heat drive the finish on this pricey wine that's not in great shape.",86,52,Northern Spain
72850,Argentina,"Neutral aromas and a mouthfeel with modest lemony acidity set up pithy citrus flavors and notes of green melon and lychee. The finish on this tropical-tasting wine is creamy and a bit heavy, with lime and green banana flavors. Drink right away.",86,12,Other

72890,US,"This bottling offers gingerbread cake, baked blueberry and smoked pork on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with finely polished tannins imparting a plush texture. Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish.",91,15,California
72900,France,"With the weight expected from a 100% Pinot Noir wine, this is rich while also textured with tight minerality and tense acidity. It is dry, concentrated with the weight of two Grand Cru vineyards behind it. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will show well with a few more months in bottle.",91,68,Champagne
72910,US,"A light, refreshing and yet complex combination of fresh-cut grapefruit and watermelon, a suggestion of apricot and cranberry in the wings, this wine is stellar in every way.

72950,US,"The aromas combine fresh lemon and apple notes with just a hint of butter. The flavors are similarly fresh and crisp, with a tangy feel and great balance.

72960,Austria,"The fresh juiciness of St. Laurent is very apparent in this ripe, full-bodied wine. There is an attractive touch of spice that lifts the black fruit flavors. The tannins are soft and the acidity adds texture. Drink now.",88,32,Burgenland
72970,Italy,"A delicious blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese, this opens with earthy aromas of freshly turned soil, black fruit and underbrush.

73040,US,"This predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon blend could actually be Cain Four this year, as there's no Malbec in the blend. Large and taut, it displays tightly wrapped prune, toast, coffee and currant aromas. Possesses a handsome mouthfeel, with full tannins, tarry pine bark and a cocoa note on the palate and back end.

73100,US,"There's value for the money in this smooth wine. It smacks of cherries, not the darker, deeper fruits of Syrah, but it does have a complex leathery, meaty edge. The tannin-acid balance is just right, and leads to a simple, fruity finish.",86,16,California
73110,US,"Has all your basic barrel-fermented Chardonnay character without being particularly complex. The wine is slightly sweet and oaky-creamy, with apricot, pineapple, peach and spicy mango flavors.",86,26,California
73120,New Zealand,"The American owners of this winery are making every effort to improve the wines, and the 2013 is certainly a step in the right direction.

73130,US,"A bouquet of spicy cinnamon and clove opens up this tightly woven wine, with perceptible tannins and rustic leather-bound elements to the nose and palate.

73170,US,"A delicious nose combines smoky oregano, thyme, marjoram, mushroom and cherry aromas on this wine from a former race-car driver.

It all resolves in a lovely, creamy finish.",92,20,Oregon
73240,Italy,"Enticing aromas of rose, strawberry and baking spice meld together in the glass while the creamy, delicious palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon. It's bright and polished, with round, smooth tannins that make this already accessible.",92,40,Piedmont

73300,France,"At 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc, this isn't a typical assemblage for Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape. Fermented and aged in concrete, it's reticent at this stage of its evolution, showing hints of paraffin and honey but remaining largely neutral. Unlike most white Ch?teauneufs, it would probably benefit from a few years of cellaring.",87,70,Rh?ne Valley
73310,Italy,"Made with the Lambrusco di Sorbara grape, this conveys aromas of crushed violet, dried red berry and toasted hazelnut. The lively palate offers raspberry, nut and pink grapefruit alongside persistent bubbles and brisk acidity. Panebianco, Golden State Wine.",87,25,Central Italy
73320,Italy,"An up-and-coming star of Barolo Serralunga, Rivetto delivers a supersized wine with immense concentration and rock-solid structure.

73400,Germany,"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now??015.",89,29,Mosel
73410,Chile,"Clean, modest lemon-lime aromas open this citrusy Sauv Blanc. Citrus, nettle, white pepper and jalape?o flavors are direct, while the finish hums with peppery spice and preserving acidity.",86,13,Chile

73430,France,"From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), this wine epitomizes the light and fresh style that comes from Gascony in the hidden southwest of France.

73450,US,"This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea. The oak is toasty with a whiff of smoke, the acidity somewhat subdued. An appealing funk of earth gives it varietal distinction.",89,49,California
73460,Germany,"While a touch weightier in mouthfeel, Schloss Vollrad's standard-label bottling, this boasts the same peach and pink-grapefruit intensity that's so appealing on the Kabinett. Edged by a lacy fray of sugar, it's lip-smackingly sweet, but irresistably quaffable and neatly balanced by a streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2020.",89,20,Rheingau
73470,US,"Intense aromatics of plum, cherry and red currant introduce this wine. There's a whiff of pencil lead, and the bold fruit flavors capture a bit of brush and bramble along with perfect, clean ripeness. A suggestion of candle wax comes up. This is a powerful wine that continually demands your attention.",94,63,Oregon
73480,France,"Generosity, expressed by the scent of sun-ripened Bosc pear peel, becomes immediately apparent. The ripe and luscious pear aromatics pervade the palate with their fruity, almost floral charm. There is some residual sweetness, boosting these flavors even more, but balance is struck by shining freshness and a pear-peel texture to finish with beguiling freshness. This is textbook stuff and utterly moreish.",94,37,Alsace
73490,US,"Named for Edwards' first grandchild born in this vintage year, this wine is made from fruit sourced from Meredith Estate Vineyard. Velvety smooth and perfumed, it offers piquant pepper and cardamom scents, along with intense rhubarb compote and raspberry flavors. It shows both purpose and quiet power, wrapped in violet and rose.",94,98,California
73500,US,"There's a pleasantly gamy nose to this dry-farmed Zin, with sour-plum fruit, hoisin sauce and dried purple flowers blending into a memorable scent. The palate packs lavender, cola, oregano, dried mint and black-pepper flavors that give character to the elegant purple-fruit backbone.",89,28,California
73510,US,"A blend of various estates from the Paso Robles region, this wine shows roasted pork with blackberry hoisin sauce, black rocks and a touch of dill on the nose. Notable tannins provide lasting structure, with flavors of black olive, tobacco ash, peppercorns, dark chocolate and deep black fruit that will need a tad more time to unravel.",89,24,California
73520,Italy,"You'll find aromas of elderflower, hay, crushed rock and a whiff of exotic fruit on this linear white. On the bright palate, assertive acidity underscores grapefruit, green melon, chopped herb and mineral.",88,45,Northeastern Italy

73570,Italy,"There's a thick, slightly muddled quality to this wine (made with Manzoni grapes) that recalls peach, yellow rose, almond and honey. The mouthfeel is soft and medium in intensity.",85,14,Veneto
73580,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity, which fortunately balances the sugary orange jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors. Without that crispness, the wine would be nothing but sweetness. Wherever the acidity came from, it's welcome.",85,24,California

73600,France,"This is a balanced, ripe wine full of apple and orange fruit, and with a fine, textured character. It has weight and caramel richness, and just a hint of wood. It should be aged before drinking, so wait until 2016.",89,,Bordeaux
73610,Austria,"This has an austere, mineral feel that exascerbates it's rigid structure. Firm, drying tannins dominate the palate. Ripe black fruits at the core of the wine will need time to come through, so don't drink before 2015.",89,66,Eisenberg
73620,US,"This Napa Valley boutique winery now ventures into Oregon, with a tart, juicy and aromatic Pinot Noir from the Roserock vineyard. Despite all the criticism about the thin wines from the 2011 vintage, there have been some wonderful examples, with finesse and detail.

73630,Argentina,"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc opens with rustic, untamed earth and leather aromas.

Drink through 2021.",92,39,Mendoza Province
73640,Portugal,"Touriga Nacional and Syrah make a harmonious blend in this dense, structured wine. With complex tannins that need to soften into the ripe fruit, the wine is still developing. It's dry for now, although the black plum and berry flavors will be delicious. Drink this age worthy wine from 2017.",91,,Alentejano

73680,Spain,"The people at Hidalgo in Sanlúcar have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque.",92,18,Andalucia
73690,Spain,"Quite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality.

Velvety tannins, brisk red-currant acidity and meandering traces of smoked meat and game contribute finesse and depth. It's ready to drink now but should improve further through 2023.",91,43,New York
73720,US,"This is a hearty and quite delicious wine, although nuances of the Grenache grape are overshadowed by richness.

The palate offers licorice, pepper, blueberry sauce and a very soft texture.",91,48,California
73730,France,"87-89 Barrel sample. Minty aromas give lifted smooth fruit, with an edge of caramel toast. That sweetness seems to cut through the fruit, leaving the fresh acidity behind.",88,,Bordeaux

73760,US,"This is a really fun dry wine with a distinctive black-pepper streak running from the aroma to the finish. It's medium bodied, on the lean side in texture, like pomegranate in terms of fruit flavors, firmly tannic and well-balanced. It should make a great pairing with steak au poivre.",89,35,California
73770,Czech Republic,"This deep straw-colored wine has a nose of mango, caramelized pineapple and canned apricots. A strong backbone of minerality runs through the core, bolstering flavors of peach and tropical fruit.",89,40,Moravia
73780,Spain,"Jammy aromas of red berries, red licorice sticks and green herbs filter toward a pinched mouthfeel with creamy oak for an offset. Flavors of boysenberry are dilute but fresh and friendly. Overall, this is good and easy but simple, with gaps in its fiber.",87,11,Northern Spain
73790,Spain,"Rubber band, almond skin and dry citrus aromas feed into a tight, raw, rubbery feeling palate with a low fruit quotient and more brine and bitterness than expected. This is quite dry, salty and pithy but also fresh and lively on the finish. Drink immediately.",87,25,Andalucia
73800,US,"With its high abv, this monster Cabernet Franc is quite an anomaly in the Finger Lakes. It's intensely aromatic with notes of black cherry and berries accented with bramble and forest floor. The palate packs a punch with big, concentrated black plum flavors layered in spicy oak and tannins. It's brawny and bold and sure to get attention on the dinner table.",87,30,New York
73810,US,"This Sangiovese, which includes 8% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Syrah, is lightly scented with cracker, cola and strawberry; it's a gently spicy, simple but enjoyable red.",86,22,Washington
73820,US,"Almost Port-like, with extremely high alcohol and a thick, glyceriney mouthfeel that frames superripe blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Yet the wine is very dry, and rich in its own eccentric way.",86,36,California
73830,France,"This wine is fresh, crisp and still young. Crisp acidity dominates the strongly citrus character and gives a tight aftertaste of lime and pink grapefruit. This 100% Sauvignon Blanc was aged on the lees for six months to enhance aroma. Wait to drink until early 2016.",87,12,Bordeaux
73840,France,"Attractively pink in color, this has a touch of caramel as well as ripe strawberry fruit flavors. It has a rich side, but is bright and fruity with lively acidity at the end. It will be great as an apéritif.",87,11,Bordeaux
73850,US,"Birch Creek Vineyard provides the fruit for this stainless-steel-fermented and aged wine. It offers notes of custard, lees and herbs. The clover flavors show a richer feel but the concentration doesn't all seem to be there, trailing toward the finish.",87,36,Washington
73860,Chile,"This medium weight Chardonnay offered aromas of overripe pineapple and citrus with an odd note somewhere between citrus and varnish. The apple and mild citrus flavors lack vitality, and turn overly tart on the finish.",81,10,Maipo Valley
73870,France,"Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.",89,38,Burgundy
73880,France,"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore.

73900,US,"Labeled off dry but with little or no sweetness, this is a unique effort, a rosé style with unusual length and focus. Chill this wine and drink it as an apéritif. It is most unusual—dusty, musky, and concentrated, with a fine finish that resonates with a Grand Marnier note.",88,10,Washington
73910,France,"The piles of rocks taken from the vineyard and heaped around the edge are what give the bizarre name of this vineyard. To taste, the wine is soft, sweetly ripe with an attractive, ripe creamy character, lifted by toast.",88,,Burgundy

73950,US,"A curious rosé that relies on a touch of Tempranillo to color the Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Symphony grapes, this shows sour orange and light plum on the nose. Dried strawberry and orange rind appear on the sip, which is framed by decent acidity and light tannins.",85,22,California

73980,US,"Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.",95,75,California
73990,France,"Dark and structured, this is a firm wine. It has a smoky wood character, powerful tannins over intensely ripe fruit. Acidity and sweetness balance to give a dense wine, powered with richness and destined to age for many years.",95,69,Bordeaux
74000,France,"Densely fruity wine, all sweetness and richness without too much weight. It does have power, a dark core, but it is the sweet balance that is so attractive. There is a layer of acidity as well, giving freshness to the final character of the wine.",95,,Bordeaux

74050,Spain,"Stout, leathery aromas of black fruits and grilled meats are blackened and a true reflection of Syrah. This is expansive on the palate, but also acidic and abrasive.

74060,Austria,"An aromatic touch of ivy plays alongside green pear on the nose. These aromas continue on the palate where they acquire a zesty, fresh edge reminiscent of grapefruit.

74070,Germany,"Fresh green floral and white peach aromas lend a fresh-linen perfume to this dry Riesling. The palate is a joyful array of mango and pink grapefruit flavors, braced with steely minerality and penetrating acidity. Finishes long, with a sensation of lime-pith astringency.",91,58,Mosel

74520,New Zealand,"What a clean, pretty fruit-and-flowers nose this has, and theflavors don't disappoint. Melon and citrus dominate, but it's all ripe fruit and not the least bit lean. The tail end is lengthy and layered, if maybe a bit chalky. But all in all this wine delivers the goods with a smile.",90,15,Marlborough
74530,US,"At the top of the Rancho Zabaco hierarchy are the Zinfandels from the company's Chiotti and Stefani vineyards. Unfortunately there will be no Stefani in 2000, but the Chiotti is very good. It's very young, and takes a bit of coaxing to tease out aromas of toast, dried spices and blackberries before flowing smoothly across the palate in a wave of briary fruit. Finishes with firm acidity and a bit of black pepper. Drink now.",89,25,California
74540,US,"This is a very clean, well-balanced wine, with nice hints of honey but not too much, and a lightly spicy finish.",89,25,Oregon
74550,Portugal,"A fine, ripe wine, very elegant, with its red plum and berry fruits rounded out with smooth wood flavors. The tannins, obviously here, are in a supporting role to this delicious fruit. And the aftertaste is long, rounded and soft.",91,23,Douro
74560,Italy,"Creamy and buttery with gorgeous notes of stone fruit, exotic fruit, vanilla, honey and a playful touch of banana, this wine is an exceptional companion to shellfish, clams or chowder. The aromas are direct, intense and very seductive. This is an opulent, sophisticated wine that wins high scores across the board, thanks to its genuine intensity and its crisp, flavor-rich finish.",91,23,Northeastern Italy
74570,US,"Good and complex, but smells a little candied, like mint cherry-scented toothpaste, and tastes sweetly jammy in cherries. This all-Pommard clone Pinot may be going through a mute phase. Try holding for several months.",88,55,California
74580,Italy,The bottle is elegant inside and out: this Friulano offers fragrant tones of pear and peach. The naturally structured and thick characteristics of this grape make it a perfect companion to creamy pasta dishes or meat with béchamel sauce.,88,24,Northeastern Italy
74590,US,"Light in color and soft in the glass, this well-built wine is bursting in red berry and cherry, with aromas of violet and oak and a finish laced in cherry-vanilla. Structured and finessed, it's impressive for hearty pairings like pork or game,",90,42,California
74600,Austria,"A subtle mix of pear and pepper plays on the nose. A seam of clean, fresh acidity leads to a concentrated, peppery palate where zestiness reigns, made more interesting by the aromatic pungence of lovage and arugula.",90,20,Kamptal

74650,US,"Aromas of wood spice, plum and herb lead to black-fruit flavors and chalky, dry tannins that make it hard to access.",87,39,Washington
74660,Italy,"Made with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of yellow apple, flint and medicinal herb. The somewhat lean, racy palate offers pear, mineral and lemon peel alongside brisk acidity that gives it a refreshing finish.",87,28,Central Italy
74670,France,The tannins of the vintage are very apparent in this dry wine. That gives it a dry structure that was enhanced by wood aging. It needs to develop longer and become a wine that is balanced while always austere. Drink from 2017.,87,25,Bordeaux
74680,Spain,"Light aromas of red plum and raspberry lead to a wiry, snappy feeling palate with a mix of raspberry, plum and cocoa powder flavors. This is a lean, juicy Tempranillo with modest character and a clean finish.",84,16,Northern Spain

74740,Spain,"Cheesy oak and raw cherry and plum aromas create a nose that needs time in the glass to show its best. This Rioja feels fresh and tight, with pulling tannins. Zesty plum and cherry flavors carry a peppery side note prior to a snappy finish with similar flavors.",90,60,Northern Spain

74780,Chile,"Big, oaky and toasty on the nose, and then zesty and pithy in the mouth, with citrus, tangerine, lemon and not much else. Call it a one-trick pony and get ready for citrusy flavors and little variation on that theme. The good thing is, for a Maule Chard it plays its hand right.",85,19,Maule Valley
74790,Moldova,"A zippy, lively nose of citrus and lemon leads this simple but enjoyable wine from Moldova, and on the tongue, the clean flavors continue, offering accessible, fun character that will do well chilled and on a hot summer day, Refreshing and light, with a touch of sweetness, it's priced well for everyday consumption.",83,8,Cahul

74810,Italy,"This is an expertly extracted and penetrating Sangiovese-based wine (with a small percentage of other grapes mixed in) that boasts an absolutely irresistible nose.

Black cherries and chocolate are the main themes, with coffee and chewy tannins in the mouth: An exciting discovery from a relatively unknown estate.",95,54,Tuscany
74820,Italy,"Made with mostly Merlot, with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this expertly blended red delivers a bright assortment of penetrating aromas: Exotic spice, cola, black peppercorn, leather, espresso and blackberry work together in beautiful harmony. Fine mineral accents that add yet one more interesting layer to this streamlined wine.",94,48,Tuscany
74830,Italy,"A wine that gives you everything you could possibly want: complexity, elegance, intensity and a long, creamy finish.

74860,Spain,"Fresh, perky, sweaty and citric on the nose, which all creates a textbook bouquet. The palate is slightly spritzy, with flavors of passionfruit, pineapple and sweet white grapefruit. Fresh yet a little fleshy, with a long, zesty finish. Drink as soon as possible to capture the essence of a fine vintage.",90,23,Northern Spain
74870,Argentina,"Rubbery, jammy, unfocused berry aromas are blurry. This feels heavy and low on pulse. Flavors of stewed plum and berry fruits end with a mild, weedy, green note.",82,14,Mendoza Province
74880,France,"Sweet oak aromas of vanilla extract, pencil shaving and cocoa butter flood the nose, overshadowing any pure fruit character. Soft and broad in texture, it has plum spice and sweet wood flavors that fade fast on the close.",81,10,France Other
74890,Portugal,"This fabulous wine comes from a legendary Vintage Port year. Aged in wood and only bottled in 2015, it is so concentrated and intense. The old gold and wood flavors are dominant in a beautiful wine that may be old but certainly has every possible nuance of flavor. It is one in a succession of rare and treasured Ports that occasionally emerge from Port producers cellars. Drink now.",96,400,Port
74900,France,"Now mature, this smoky, wood-aged wine is rich and complex. It has firm and dry tannins that are typical of the Tannat although these are a part of a solid, dark wine.

74940,US,"Made from Grenache, Malbec, Pinot Noir and Tempranillo, this is a light, zesty and dry wine.

74990,France,"Totally herbaceous and crisp, this is a rich, citrus-flavored wine. Grapefruit flavors dominate with a twist of lemon on top, giving a zesty texture that shows a young wine. For it to calm down and broaden out, wait until the end of 2015.",88,14,Bordeaux
75000,US,"Lime, sea shell, rainy cement and orange-rind aromas make for a brisk entry to the nose of this bottling, rounded out by a touch of pineapple. The palate is framed by a chalky grip, and shows flavors of tangy lemon and slightly sour apple.",88,19,California

75060,US,"This straightforward wine brings vanilla, citrus and toasted wood to the forefront, with interesting whiffs of petrol as well. It's still tightly wound for a white wine, so waiting until 2016 may reveal more magic.",85,15,California
75070,US,"This high-toned bruiser pushes ultraripe scents of figs and raisins and prunes to the front, yet shows a green streak in the tannins. The wine spent 34 months in barrel, which adds more heavy-duty accents but does not mask the underlying stemminess.",85,45,Oregon
75080,US,"Medium-bodied, this wine's ripe fruit characteristics offer dark plum and golden raisin flavors. It will serve most basic wine needs.",85,15,California
75090,Argentina,"Spicy mossy aromas are cool and herbal, and with that there are grapy, toasty, and chocolaty oak scents. This Malbec blend is tight and rugged, with clampy red-bery flavors resting on that same chocolaty oak. Drying tannins make for a hard finish that should mellow in due time. Drink through 2021.",89,30,Mendoza Province
75100,US,"There is no lack of luxurious, concentrated fruit flavor in this full-bodied, non-oaky wine. It tastes like ripe black cherries, feels smooth and easy for a big wine like this, and finishes with even more fruit.",89,42,California
75110,Spain,"Ripe and heavy up front, with monster-level oak, this is a bulky, massive blend of Syrah and Merlot. In the mouth, natural and barrel-related tannins are intense, while this tastes mostly of cinnamon, clove and baked berry fruits. Resiny clove-like flavors persist on a tannic beefy finish.",89,20,Central Spain
75120,Israel,"Cherry, clove and freesia aromas give way to flavors of cherry, mint, anise and clove. Well-integrated fruit and spice notes, good mouthfeel and tannins that stop just shy of chewy continue to the lasting finish. Mevushal.",87,11,Galilee
75130,US,"This 100% Merlot has high-toned aromas of worn leather and undergrowth, dark cherry and exotic spices, which lead onto the lithe, medium-bodied palate. Fine, chalky tannins and bright acids give this wine some footing, and the subtle finish comes with an herbal edge.",87,38,Virginia

75150,Argentina,"Earthy, rubbery red-berry aromas lead to a hard-drilling palate with fiery cherry flavors and an allotment of herbal mint. The hollow finish leaves a salty flavor and heat.",84,12,Mendoza Province
75160,Argentina,"Herbal, stalky aromas surround scents of asphalt and animal hide as well as generic berry notes. A lively palate holds flavors of herbal, leafy plum, raw wood and funk, while the finish is tangy in feel, with flavors of dry oak and hints of green.",84,17,Mendoza Province
75170,France,"Bright and fruity, this wine has all the richness of whites in this vintage. It has yellow fruits, citrus and a warm, rounded texture. There is just a touch of herbal acidity at the end to keep it fresh.",86,12,Bordeaux
75180,US,"This wine is composed of near equal parts Idaho, Washington and California fruit. It starts out a touch reduced, with black currant and sugared-plum aromas. It drinks a hair off dry, which offsets a dry lick of tannins. It's eponymous pairing should work perfectly.",86,11,America
75190,US,"There's an intriguing touch of grassiness on the nose of this bottling that also shows restrained yet tropical aromas of mango and green papaya. The palate is less interesting, with light melon flavors and a lack of bright acidity.",86,16,California
75200,US,"Lots of buttered toast and butterscotch flavors mark this Chardonnay. It's balanced, however, with crisp acidity and bright flavors of tropical fruit and peach, along with a fragrant honeysuckle note.",87,30,California
75210,Italy,"This oak-dominated wine recalls the ubiquitous wood-driven Tuscan offerings from the late 1990s and early 2000s. A blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Syrah, it delivers hardcore oak, wood chips, vanilla, chocolate and espresso sensations, with black currant and blackberry lying low in the foreground.",87,75,Tuscany
75220,France,"This is a balanced wine that is quite ready to drink now. It has black fruits, soft tannins and a deliciously juicy character. It's full bodied, but has a lively, fresh acidity on the finish.",87,23,Bordeaux
75230,France,"Ripe, relatively full-bodied Muscadet with a soft texture of ripe Granny Smith apples and touches of apricot. It does have a dry, crisp finish that provides some tight acidity, although its softness lets it work as both an aperitif and a food wine.",88,,Loire Valley
75240,US,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvedre, this is a full-bodied, smoothly fruity wine for drinking now. It has rich blackberry and cherry flavors, with a hit of sweet, smoky oak.",88,42,California
75250,US,"The tannins give this wine a lockdown feeling, making it hard and astringent. But the fruit is strong and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's forward and one-dimensional now, but delicious, and unlikely to improve with age.",88,40,California
75260,Austria,"This blend of St. Laurent, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers glossy, polished plum fruit that is still closed now, but promises to come to the fore after some cellaring. Great concentration on the midpalate, fresh acidity and finely-woven tannins also bode well for the future of this wine. There is a mineral, gravelly, spicy background that promises more interest and aromatic layers. Ready from 2016.",88,,Thermenregion
75270,South Africa,"Despite the age of this wine, it's still bright and lively, with clean and upfront aromas and flavors of orange citrus, white melon rind, white peach and firm pear. The palate is vibrant and fresh, with mouthwatering acidity that follows through to the toast-laced finish.",88,21,Robertson
75280,US,"Anyone could be forgiven for thinking this was a Pinot Noir. Like its more famous cousin, this wine is dry and silky, with a delicate mouthfeel framing serious raspberry, cola, mushroom and oak flavors. The winemaker suggests serving it below room temperature, which is a good idea.",88,38,California
75290,Portugal,"This is a lightly off-dry rosé, with a soft texture and strawberry flavors. The wine is easy to drink now, bright with acidity and smoothly finished.",84,18,Alentejano

75310,Argentina,"With little fruit to the nose, this cool-climate Chardonnay smells strained. A chunky palate has a canned-fruit character, tasting faintly of peach and mandarin orange. It lacks freshness, fruit and varietal correctness.",83,17,Other
75320,Australia,"This remains a richly textured and weighty rosé, despite the fact that its color seems lighter than previous vintages. It's almost entirely Grenache, with bits of Shiraz (4%), Cabernet Sauvignon (2%) and Dolcetto (1%) filling out the blend. Hints of berries, ripe melon and white chocolate end on a mouthwatering citrus note, but this is built for the beefy side of your grilling menu.",90,20,South Australia
75330,Italy,"Attractive aromas of dark berry, blue flower, sweet baking spice and a whiff of pipe tobacco waft out of the glass. The fresh, tight palate delivers tart cherry, crunchy strawberry, white pepper, clove and chopped herb alongside firm, polished tannins. It still needs to unwind. Drink 2017??027.",90,51,Piedmont
75340,Italy,"This vibrant red opens with aromas of ground pepper, dark-skinned fruit and blue flower. The tight palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb along a backbone of firmly packed, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and needs to unwind. Drink 2017??022.",90,40,Piedmont
75350,Italy,"A highly nuanced nose leaning more toward animal and mineral notes than fruit opens this muscular effort. Leather, ash and forest fire flavors dominate the palate, framed by sinewy tannins. A few cherry notes peek through the tar-infused finish. Serve with game.",91,60,Piedmont
75360,Argentina,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",91,25,Mendoza Province
75370,US,"Dark, smoky and oaky, this ripe wine tastes very much of the 40% Primitivo featured in the blend. It has nice structure, with Syrah, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah also in the mix. It's ready to drink, especially with pasta with an herb sauce.",87,25,California
75380,Argentina,"This smells of exotic blueberry and graham cracker, and it feels wide and solid, with herbal, woodsy flavors of juniper and plum. Dry and healthy on the finish, this made from 75% Malbec, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Tannat in the blend.",87,17,Other
75390,US,"Whiffs of sour Asian plums and briar patch add complexity to the fleshy cherry aromas of this composed, full-bodied wine. Brisk acidity and hints of spice, wet earth and soy sauce lend a sweet and savory tone to it's black-cherry-flavored finish.",87,25,New York
75400,US,"Slightly unripe, with an herbaceousness that interferes with the blackberries and currants, making the oak stick out uncomfortably. Sharp, too. But it's good and richly tannic, and dry. Made from all five traditional Bordeaux varieties.",86,25,California
75410,US,"A good Cabernet, but outclassed in a flight by its more concentrated and attractive competitors. Taste too fruity, in a jammy sense, and over-oaked, showing lots of upfront vanilla extract and buttered toast. Could well develop bottle character after 2012, but it's a dice throw.",86,50,California
75420,US,"Good and rich, but tastes too oaky, with the pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors swamped by vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. Other than that, there's a fine, crisp minerality to the finish.",86,40,California
75430,Bulgaria,"Made from the Thracian Valley's indigenous Mavrud grape, this wine has an enticing aroma of leather, blackberry and tobacco. The flavor is savory and spicy—rich with tobacco. Moderately complex with aging potential. Pair with rich, savory meat dishes.",85,9,Thracian Valley
75440,Italy,"If you're looking for a bright, easy wine to pair with pasta or pizza, this is it. Ruby-colored and medium-bodied, this Chianti offers informal aromas of wild berry, almond and cola backed by crisp acidity that makes it that much more appropriate as a companion to easy dishes.",85,,Tuscany
75450,US,"Estate-grown, barrel-fermented, and richly extracted, this young Viognier has not yet shed its sharp edges. The fruit is generous and compact, a mix of peach, apricot and pineapple, with liquorous barrel flavors dominating.",88,28,Washington

75470,US,"Hints of spice, dried herb and black tea lend an elegant earthiness to concentrated, but crisp, black cherry and berry flavors on this Cabernet Franc. The palate is full bodied but structured with a flurry of soft tannins that linger on the finish.",87,25,New York
75480,US,"Hints of nut oil and smoke lend a savory tone to bright stone-fruit and floral notes on this delicate semidry Riesling. Brisk with lemon-lime acidity, it finishes long with a murmur of lanolin and honey comb.",87,14,New York
75490,Italy,"This estate delivered a fine Rosso di Montalcino in 2008 and less certain results with its Brunello the same year. The issue is the sharp acidity that really makes your mouth pucker. Thankfully, the intense crispness is balanced by softer spice, black fruit and tobacco aromas.",87,75,Tuscany
75500,Argentina,"Smoky, earthy and refined on the nose, this Cab is showing a seamless mix of berry and oak-based aromas. Full, moderately tannic, layered and thorough on the palate, this tastes of baked berry fruits, integrated oak and loamy earth. A ripe yet balanced finish indicates that aging is needed. Drink through 2025.",93,95,Mendoza Province
75510,Italy,"Multifaceted aromas of dark cherry, leather, pressed violet, iron, dark spice and a balsamic note take shape on this intriguing red.

75530,Spain,"A pronounced scent of lilacs marks the nose of this wine, making it distinctive, to say the least. It’s more traditional in its flavors, with some herbal and strawberry nuances. Finishes a bit short and ever-so-slightly sweet, but a decent quaff.",85,8,Catalonia
75540,US,"Smells young and juicy, with ripe blackberry, chocolate and olivaceous notes, and a dollop of smoky oak. Drinks fruity and dry, with a bite of acidity, and finishes sharp. Contains a little Merlot from Marin County and some Cabernet Franc from Amador County in the Sierra Foothills",84,20,California
75550,US,"Light in color, almost rusty. Fleshy aromas of chunky, brambly fruit also offer a lot of pepper, both black and green. With good body and texture, you’re hopeful for more in the mouth, but the fruit is marred by the essence of veggies, even tasting a bit stewed.",82,15,California
75560,US,"It's rare to see Sémillon coming out of this esteemed vineyard. This somewhat unusual wine brings bright aromas of lime verbena, pear and herb that lead to lean dry, lightly smoky flavors backed by tart acidity.",88,20,Washington

75670,France,"Rich, packed with  juicy fruit. The wine has weight, depth of fruit flavor and tannins as a central core. A smoky character indicates the wood aging, packing in with the acidity and black cherry fruits on the finish. Age for 5?? years.",93,105,Burgundy
75680,US,"Meaty and leathery, with sweet, salty bacon notes meshing with intense wild blackberry fruit, this Syrah is delicious and sexy. The tannins are wonderfully plush and refined, like satin. It's perfect to drink now with short ribs of beef or any kind of beef or lamb stew.",93,36,California

75740,US,"For a few dollars more than the regular CSM Cabernet, the Indian Wells delivers extra density and complexity. It holds firm, dark fruits and is slightly grainy, but well-ripened tannins carry the wine, and it's less dependent upon oak treatments and flavors of vanilla and cream. Persistent and substantial, it's offers good value, and often sells for less than the listed price.",89,18,Washington
75750,US,"This has a pruney character in keeping with the high 15.4% alcohol. It's dark and liquorous, beyond ripe, and finishes hot, with chalky, earthy tannins.",85,20,Washington

75810,Argentina,"Familiar Cab Franc aromas of dry spice, green herbs, fennel and pepperoni feed into a narrow palate that's high in acidity and drawing. Spiky tomato, plum, herb and pepper flavors finish dry and pulling, with a saucy aftertaste.",87,40,Mendoza Province
75820,France,"In the style of this producer, this is a rich wine. It has ripe yellow fruits as well as the more mineral, crisp character that comes from the tangy Sauvignon Blanc. The wine is still young, needing a few more months. So drink from 2018.",87,20,Loire Valley

75890,Italy,"This fun dessert wine has delicate aromas of citrus, tropical fruit and fragrant white flower.

75920,Spain,"Concentrated dark berry aromas are powerful on the nose, showing a touch reduced but minerally. The palate on this young Ribera wine is pure and potent but not fierce.

75950,US,"The ripest of Diamond Creek's new '09 Cabernets, Red Rock shows a sun-blasted quality of red currants, blueberry and cassis. Heady and exotic, this is rich in tannins and noble in acidity. While it's a joy to drink now and over the next eight years, its extreme ripeness may limit its longterm ageability.",95,175,California
75960,Italy,"An upfront and easy personality characterizes this Riserva Chianti. The wine's aromas are not particularly complex but do include fundamentals such as cherry, spice and vanilla. It's a medium-bodied wine that would pair with white meat or pasta.",85,,Tuscany

76200,France,"Lifted notes of chamomile and lemon rind hit the nose. The palate is wonderfully taut and tight, fresh and precise and displays a wonderful Riesling contradiction: a bone-dry taut wine can be laser-like on the palate and yet have whirls of rich rounded expansive flavors. Here they are of citrus zest, yarrow, lanolin and pure lemon oil. Savor this slowly and feel enriched. Drink now through 2030.",94,49,Alsace
76210,US,"This winery always manages to pack in rich fruit and hearty spice. This bottling shows bay leaf, anise, pine needle and black tea aromas that accent a core of plum. That hearty dark fruit carries through to the palate as well, but warms up with earthy soil, licorice and minty fudge flavors. A luscious, lingering mouthful.",94,39,California
76220,US,"Mocha cream, pencil shaving and dried herb aromas are set against a backdrop of black currant fruit in this big but balanced bottling from the Daou brothers. It's soft on the palate, where the texture commands as much attention as the flavors, in a matrix of mouth-coating tannins that frame its cola, cocoa, black plum and cherry notes.",94,85,California
76230,France,"This is largely Viognier from the Southern Rh?ne, and that's reflected in its aromas of honey and pineapple. The flavors are fresh and slightly herbal, but based in melon and pineapple. It's medium in body, then finishes on a mouthwatering citrus note.",89,14,Rh?ne Valley

76250,Portugal,"A new venture to the Douro by Tejo-based Lagoalva, this is juicy, fruity and soft. While it misses the minerality of many Douro wines, it does have ripe plum fruit flavors, and an open, generous texture. This is a warm full-bodied wine that's ready to drink.",88,,Douro
76260,US,"Organically grown grapes are put to fine use in this rich, crisp Chardonnay that is highly attuned with acidity. Pressed whole-cluster, the grapes yield a wine that tends toward sour green apple, balanced with a texture that lends it some heft.",87,20,California

76280,Italy,"Fragrant blue flower, ripe berry, scorched earth and a whiff of new leather unfold in the glass. The big, chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, ground pepper, clove, star anise and a hint of game framed in youthfully austere, teeth coating tannins. Drink after 2021.",92,70,Tuscany
76290,France,"In any given year, one or the other of Trignon's varietal cuvées excels, and 2013 is a Marsanne year. The delicate aromas of white pepper and spring blossoms immediately intrigue, and the flavors don't disappoint. This wine is floral, spicy and fruity all at once, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",92,19,Rh?ne Valley
76300,US,"There's a feral quality to this single-vineyard bottling, with dried rose petals, damp pine needles, dehydrated shiitake mushrooms and touches of violet, potpourri and dried ginger on the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety, with lilac and lavender decorating a base of cranberry and boysenberry fruit.",92,50,California
76310,US,"Lots of juicy cherry, black raspberry, vanilla and smoky flavors in this soft wine, but it struggles to rise above simplicity. Would benefit from blending with harder, darker, more tannic varieties, like Syrah or Petite Sirah.",84,26,California

76340,France,"Richly textured and spicy, this is a finely integrated wine. It has ripe berry flavors and a palate that's textured with tannins from fruit as well as wood. The structure, held within a lacework of acidity, reflects the wine's potential. Drink from 2016.",88,16,Bordeaux
76350,Spain,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are straightforward but welcoming.

A peppery finish shows juicy acidity and warmth.",88,14,Northern Spain

76370,Italy,"Sirch has shaped a simple and direct expression of Ribolla Gialla that seemingly reduces the grape's characteristics down to the pure essentials.

76380,Spain,"Initially the nose on this blend from the Toledo area offers dark cherry and hard spice aromas, but with airing things drop off to soupy and herbal.

76390,US,"This conveys a heady mix of luscious French oak, butter and toast, plus roasted nuts, a dash of Cognac, orange oil, apple sauce and baked pear.

76400,France,"Rich, rounded and ripe, this is an opulent wine, dense and balanced between ripe yellow and white fruits and acidity. A zesty, tangy and crisp texture both gives it a lift and offers delicious, refreshing acidity. Drink from 2017.",94,,Burgundy
76410,Portugal,"What's 25 Barricas? The 25 barrels of this wine. It is a grand wine that has dark tannins, firm structure and rich fruit all in the right places. Of course, it is young, so the firm, dry tannins need to soften out. It's the balance that winemaker Jorge Moreira commands that makes it so good. The result is a wine that will age impressively over many years. Drink this powerful wine from 2019.",94,,Douro

76450,US,"This lusty Zin shows the briary, brambly character of Dry Creek Valley that always makes its Zins taste a little rustic, which in no way detracts from its deliciousness. Dry and rich in tannins, it has long, deep flavors of spices, perfectly ripe summer berries and an herbal bitterness suggestive of chamomile tea and wild nettles. A better pizza wine cannot be imagined.",89,36,California
76460,US,"Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer presses Syrah and Mourvèdre to make this rosé, hoping that in the process he'll best preserve the wine's aromas and also keep it tasting fresh.

It's very light and dry, leaving you with the impression of having just bitten into a piece of watermelon.",89,16,California
76470,Chile,"Dark, muscular and very oaky, especially early on where it smells charred and bacony, with black fruit in the background. Airing unleashes chewy, roasted berry, plum, carob and herbal flavors, and throughout there is a strong oak element. Finishes big and thick, with toast and leafy, herbal Pinot Noir nuances.",88,20,Casablanca Valley
76480,US,"Made in a very big, heavy and ripe style, this Pinot Noir offers waves of grilled blackberry, cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with sweet, smoky influences from oak barrels. It's delicious, but lacks delicacy and subtlety. Drink now.",88,55,California

76540,Germany,"An interesting example of dry Riesling, one that displays a dense, honeyed bouquet and flavors that resemble honey but without the sweetness. Hard to imagine, but that's the closest approximation I can come up with. It's creamy on the midpalate and fairly full bodied (12.5% abv) for a wine from this far north.",89,41,Mosel
76550,US,"With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending. But for those who want to glimpse the future of Malbec in southern Oregon, this is a touch point. Delicate, balanced, herbal, mixing a wash of light fruits with nuances of herb, this very drinkable wine has appealing delicacy and verve.",89,24,Oregon
76560,Italy,"Diomede is a plusher, chewier expression of Aglianico with background notes of vanilla and sweet spice that peek between dominant aromas of blackberry and cassis.

76570,US,"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine.

The length and balance, along with the pure pleasure, far exceed the price.",94,36,Washington
76590,US,"A blend of 27% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 27% Syrah and 16% Cabernet Franc, this is an accessible wine, with cherry, caramel, chocolate and toast flavors that comprise the heart of the palate. The best guess is to enjoy it now, as it is probably at or near its drinking peak.",88,20,Washington
76600,US,"This 100% Cabernet Franc shows the high alcohol, full body and concentrated power expected from a Rock Wall bottling.

76640,Canada,"There's a touch of green here, noticeable principally as a streak of green olive. It's a feature, not a problem, and smoothes out into a subtle mix of dates, figs and a touch of prune. Notes of smoke and earth come along with well-balanced tannins through a lingering finish.",90,22,British Columbia

76700,US,"Although this is the winery's reserve-level blend, it doesn't work well in this vintage. Vague and muted, the mix of grapes lacks focus, offering just a thin, generic red wine with a chalky aftertaste.",83,42,Oregon
76710,Germany,"While still a bit closed on the nose, this vibrant off-dry Riesling develops rich, concentrated strokes of tangerine and stone fruit on the palate. It's sun-kissed and cheery, balanced elegantly with pert, citrus-toned acidity.",90,22,Mosel

76970,Spain,"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas.

77230,South Africa,"Winemaker: Danie Steytler. Direct and clean aromas of Anjou pear, apple flesh, hay, citrus zest, lime leaf and wet stone greet you on the nose of this attractive old-vine Chenin Blanc.

77800,US,"Beautiful, classic blackberry and currant fruit in this polished Cabernet, along with a rich, tasteful coat of sweet oak. The tannins are thick but refined.

Drink through 2018.",92,43,Mendoza Province
77890,Portugal,"The wine, of course, is young and needs to age in order to bring out its ripe, smooth fruit. In spite of its fruitiness, it is bright and poised, although there is an odd edge of candied fruits here as well. The wine should be drunk from the end of 2016.",85,12,Tejo

78120,Portugal,"One of the iconic wines of Portugal, the brand dates back to the 15th century and the Portuguese discovery of Brazil. In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness. The structure is all there in what is still a young wine. With power and a dense texture, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",94,275,Alentejo
78130,Portugal,"This is produced from a field selection of at least 20 different varieties. Dark in color, it is big and bold in flavor.

Drink from 2020.",94,70,Douro
78140,Portugal,"This is a rich, complex wine that has great tannins as well as very fine, ripe black fruits. It comes from the showpiece estate for Casa Ferreirinha in the Alto Douro.

78220,Austria,"This is a compelling red for those who like a bit of mystery: is it red or black cherry? Or possibly, dark, aromatic elderberry? Oak spicily supports this interchange of fruit, and firm tannins lend structure while the fresh acidity keeps it lively. It's almost like a whole cast of characters were lined up in this wine for your entertainment. The lingering finish is especially convincing. This will get even better with cellaring; drink from 2016.",93,100,Burgenland
78230,France,"From a parcel within the Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru, this is a structured, serious Gewuztraminer.

Drink from 2016.",93,30,Alsace

78830,US,"Distinctive aromas of clove, black-cherry syrup, gingerbread cookies, allspice and nutmeg combine ripe fruit with exotic spice in a wondrous way, almost recalling women's perfume. There's a similar quality to the palate, where brown spice, dried ginger and plum fruit are embedded in a medium tannic structure and weight. It provides a fascinating take on an old, forgotten grape.",93,32,California
78840,US,"The mighty Hirsch rises to the occasion of a burly, near-perfect vintage, showing off its ability to be brawny and brainy at the same time.

Drink now after decanting or cellar through 2023.",93,78,California
78850,France,"This wine has plenty of fruit, but even in the open 2013 vintage, it is still firm, structured and with nervy minerality. The richness and the ripe yellow fruits are still to come, meaning that this complex wine should wait until 2018.",93,160,Burgundy

78910,Portugal,"This late-harvest wine has hints of honeyed botrytis as well as apricot fruitiness, though it is far from cloyingly sweet. The texture is soft and mature, with good integration of the fruit and the botrytis character. Try it now with cheese or foie gras.",90,16,D?o
78920,US,"Peachy Canyon NV Mustang Springs Ranch Port (Paso Robles); $40. What you need in a Port-style wine is sugary, caramelized sweetness, the deep, strong taste of fruit, high alcohol and crisp acidity. This wine has them all.

It combines flint, pencil lead, smoked wood, chopped chives, sweet onion, crushed limestone and a touch of white pepper on the stonefruit-based nose.

79110,Spain,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

79490,Spain,"With a gold color and heavy, pithy aromas that are becoming oxidized, this is a mature, highly stylized Albari?o. It's also a touch flat, with flavors of bitter citrus and nectarine pit. Overall this is more leesy and mature than vital and outwardly delicious.",86,60,Galicia
79500,US,"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition.

79780,US,"Sourced entirely from the Winter's Hill vineyard, this is a lively mix of raspberry, lime, pineapple and cherry candy. Young and tart, it needs more time to flesh out and show more detail.

79980,US,"Surprisingly, in the blind lineup, Ingleside's regular bottling of Merlot fared slightly better than its Reserve bottling of the same vintage. Overall, this is a supple wine, with flavors of chocolate-covered cherry and clove as well as a note of pear drop that cuts through the core.",83,18,Virginia
79990,France,"This is perfumed and lemony, almost to the point of resembling furniture polish. It's pleasantly silky in texture, but the recurring notes of white pepper and citrus become somewhat one-dimensional and slightly bitter on the finish.",83,30,Rh?ne Valley
80000,Germany,"While intensely youthful on the nose with aromas of fresh red cherries and blossom, the wine seems to build in depth and maturity on the palate. Fresh red fruit turns deeper and darker, and pretty floral notes pick up hints of potpourri and fall foliage. Elegant yet seductive, it is delicious now, but should mature beautifully through 2019??021.",91,20,Rheinhessen
80010,US,"Pretty and perfumed it exhibits dark cherry from start to finish. Spice and cola notes explode midway through, and that see-saw balance between fruit and spice persists into the finish. Round and soft, with a lean texture, it's very enjoyable.",90,36,California
80020,Austria,"Some lively spritz gives this pear-peel and aloe-scented white even more cleansing freshness. There is something of a cool, pure mountain stream about this wine, with fine, ripe green pear at is core and a yeasty aftertaste.",90,,Wagram-Donauland

The alcohol is high, tempered by a velvety texture and moderate tannins.",92,34,California
80060,US,"At nearly seven years in age, this 100% Cabernet is still offering ripe, fresh blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors. It feels young, with firm, hard tannins, but very fine and complex. Just at the beginning of its journey, it will easily reward further cellaring. Hold until 2015, at the very least.",93,135,California
80070,Germany,"Intensely earthy notes of honey and wax, and just the faintest whiff of petrol, are enticing precursors of maturity within an otherwise delightfully fresh, fruity Riesling. It's delicately crisp on the palate, but ends with a long, lanolin-coated finish.",93,42,Mosel
80080,Austria,"Ripe mango, peach and pineapple all come together in this rich, opulent wine. Round yet there's a strong ginger and spice component. This is a complex wine, textured, rich and worth aging for at least another two years. Glass stopper.",92,38,Südsteiermark

80100,US,"With residual sugar at 15 grams/L, this definitely drinks off dry. The fruit is spicy and bright, rounded off with a lick of honey. Apple, pear, lemon verbena and even a suggestion of breakfast tea come through.",87,20,Oregon
80110,US,"Soft blue and black fruit play on the palate in this straightforward, well-made wine, which is layered and robust in tannin. A savory taste of gunpowder and tobacco pique on the finish.",87,20,California

80130,US,"Soft and supple, this quite approachable wine has simple, lightly fruity flavors. It's generic, pleasant and ready to drink, with some milk chocolaty oak in the finish. Though it lists at 14.6% alcohol, it does not have commensurate weight or density of flavor.",83,28,Washington

80180,Portugal,"This is Vallado's entry-level wine, full of open, easy, expressive fruit. Yet, it also shows the natural structure and texture that comes from schist soil. Its tannins remain in the background, with black currant fruit and acidity in the fore. Drink now.",88,23,Douro
80190,US,"This hearty blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc, 24% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot offers blackberry, smoked beef, vanilla, cola and anise scents on the nose.

80200,Italy,"Much of the improvements made to the celebrated Pajé cru are thanks to the Roagna family that owns a large part of it. Here is a cellared Riserva with darker concentration and heft followed by broad aromas of tobacco, leather, spice and plummy fruit.

80260,France,"For a plump, medium- to full-bodied wine, this is pungent and citrusy, with lemon and boxwood notes that give the impression of underripeness, despite the labeled alcohol. It's 25% each Clairette, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne, 20% Marsanne and 5% Bourboulenc.",83,13,Rh?ne Valley

80360,US,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), limned with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,19,Washington

80380,Argentina,"There's a fine line between ripe and overripe, and this awkwardly toes that line with syrupy aromas and a sticky mouthfeel.

80410,US,"This twin county blend is a sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc. It shows the gooseberry tartness that Capture is known for, but not too much, with richer notes of citrus fruits and white flowers dominating. One quibble is that the wine is a little too sweet.",87,30,California

Now through 2012.",91,30,California
80640,France,"Produced from a small acre of land in Margaux, this is made in the same extravagant style as the cult wines of Saint-Emilion.

80910,France,"The great 2009 vintage in the Loire has produced a rich wine, the wood flavors balancing with the full black plum fruit. There is a toasty character that acts as a counterpoint. Along with the acidity, the flavors suggest a wine for aging over 2?? years.",90,40,Loire Valley
80920,US,"A beautiful Syrah, softly tannic, dry and full bodied. High alcohol gives some jalape?o pepper heat to the blackberries, licorice, bacon, dark chocolate and sandalwood flavors, but nothing that richly sauced barbecue can't handle. Drink up.",90,34,California

81030,US,"There is just the slightest whiff of barnyard here, delicate enough to be a feature rather than a flaw.

81040,US,"A big, rich, exuberant Malbec, one of the better ones out there. It's firm in tannins, yet soft and luscious, with deep, dark plum, cassis, beef jerky and spice flavors. Grows even finer and elegant as it warms in the glass.",90,45,California
81050,US,"This single-vineyard blend includes Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc Musque, from a one-acre site in the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's labeled as a field blend, which suggests that the grapes were co-fermented; the results are harmonious and quite appealing.

81060,US,"Apolloni seems to be the first Oregon winery to take advantage of a change in the state's labeling laws allowing Pinot Grigio to be used; previously Pinot Gris was required.

The palate on this blend of Carmenère and Malbec is a touch narrow in feel, but it's not at all thin.

81540,US,"This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades.

82660,US,"Rachis refers to a particular part of the grape stem, and indicates that roughly one quarter of this wine is whole cluster fermented.

It's plush enough to drink now, but should age well through at least 2030.",93,90,Hawke's Bay
82740,Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",81,19,Mendoza Province
82750,Italy,"This sweet wine from Italy is guaranteed to blow your socks off. Its thickness and density resembles concentrated maple syrup or molasses.

Unctuous citrus and stone fruits abound: a luscious mix of Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit, peach and apricot.

Though entirely ageworthy, this is so thoroughly delicious already you'll want to drink at least a bottle or two immediately. Drink now through 2035.",96,38,Oregon
82830,France,"Fermented and aged briefly in wood, this is dry, intense and toasty while still giving space for white fruits and some citrus. Richly endowed, spicy, and tangy, its structure and tight texture mark it out as a Champagne for long-term aging.

82880,US,"This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5?? years.",95,60,California
82890,US,"Shows good Chardonnay character, with pleasant citrus and tropical fruit, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The acidity is fine, but it's watery, lacking depth and fullness. Disappointing from this producer.",85,30,California
82900,US,"Sourced from the Crawford vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley, this inexpensive Syrah seems a bit stripped.

82940,US,"A delicate balance of geranium, peach blossom and ginger cookie shows on the nose and palate, with an additional herbal hop notes chiming in for the flavors.

83100,Spain,"Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins.

83170,Austria,"Tender but rich notes of damask rose dominate the nose.

83320,US,"From the Oak Knoll District and estate-grown fruit, this 100% varietal wine has a substantial amount of vanilla and cherry at its heart. Medium bodied, structured and soft, it retains fine-grained tannins that should mellow in the cellar, through 2022.",92,58,California
83330,Portugal,"Almost black in color, this powerful wine from vines in the Douro Superior region is impressively ripe and concentrated. Dark tannins, brooding black plum flavors and a solid age worthy structure will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2018.",92,20,Douro
83340,Italy,"Cantina del Nebbiolo is a cooperative winery with 175 members. This gorgeous base Barbaresco has been shaped by light wood influences that are integrated so well, they appear only as aromatic highlights over the wine's rich fruit component. There's spice, cinnamon and clove and the wine's mouthfeel is rich and continuous.",91,,Piedmont
83350,France,"Smooth, nutty character, with fine maturity along with grapefruit acidity. The Champagne is beautifully elegant, with hints of orange zest, finishing with a balanced toastiness.",91,69,Champagne
83360,US,"A stunningly beautiful Cabernet, made from the estate vineyard of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Softly tannic and dry, it shows lush flavors of green olives, black cherries, anise and smoky oak that swirl into a long, impressive finish. Drinkable now for sheer beauty, it will develop over the next decade.",96,65,California
83370,US,"A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.",95,90,California
83380,US,"Pretty orange blossom and yellow peach aromas against a backdrop of petrol make this “gently dry,??light-bodied Riesling a classic expression of the grape. Lots of ripe stonefruit and florals shower the palate, leading to a persistent finish marked with vibrant acidity and a bright lime skin finish.",87,15,New York
83390,Italy,"Compared to the 2003 vintage, the fruit is slightly more vibrant and polished here. There's also a slightly green note of herb or dill that we didn't notice in the past. The mouthfeel is, however, bright, crisp and refreshingly informal.",87,27,Veneto
83400,Italy,"Roberto Mazzi's family has produced a spicy and thick vineyard-designate Valpolicella with lush tones of mature fruit followed by toasted nut and old leather. Crisp berry tones, a thin mouthfeel and fresh acidity are framed against a background of ripe berry fruit.",87,,Veneto
83410,US,"Very fresh and ripe Bing cherries, black plums and roasted figs are balanced on the nose of this wine by chopped mint. It's elegantly complex on the palate, rising in flavor through the sip, with red cherries, purple flowers, smoked meats and a dried garlic-meets-shiitake sense of umami. Firm tannins suggest moderate ageability.",91,57,California
83420,Spain,"A mix of floral and schisty cherry, raspberry and strawberry aromas are subtle, elegant and reserved. This blend of Garnacha and Syrah is fresh, but with a touch of jammy weight. Flavors of minerally plum and red currant are supported by oak and vanilla notes, while the finish is tight, racy and peppery in flavor. Drink through 2018.",90,31,Catalonia
83430,Portugal,"Produced from old bush vines, this is densely rich wine, with great structure and layers of full-bodied black fruit tones. It has a fruit and acid balance supported by concentrated tannins. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.",90,16,Tejo
83440,US,"This late release is dry verging on astringent, with a tight shell of herb and stem. Inside a good core of tart fruit—cranberry and raspberry—still seems young and suggests that decanting and/or further bottle age will see this wine continue to improve.",88,21,Oregon
83450,France,"Crisp and very clean, it holds flavors of red berries. It hints at a tannic structure that gives weight to the intense acidity of the young fruit. It should be given a few months more in bottle, so drink from late 2014.",88,26,Loire Valley
83460,US,"Long hangtime fruit is the star of this Pinot, which is pretty much as good as the winery's more expensive bottlings, making it a comparative value. The raspberry, cherry, tea, cola and Indian spice flavors developed perfectly in this perfect vintage, giving the wine an elaborate richness, while crisp coastal acidity provides balancing tartness. It wants some time in the cellar. Give it until 2012 to begin to develop bottle complexity.",91,55,California
83470,US,"The winery held back this brut-style wine for eleven years. Even at this great age, the wine tastes young and vibrant in acidity, with rich strawberry, orange, lime and yeast flavors, finished with sweet vanilla. Tastes beautiful now, but extraordinary as it is, it should gain traction over the next ten years.",95,50,California
83480,Portugal,"From 1800-foot vineyards, this is a crisp, cool, simply fruity wine that has great citrus and lemon character. Very aromatic, with green herb and fresh grapefruit zest over apple juice.",88,33,Douro
83490,US,"A lovely Cabernet. Shows the softness and herbaceousness that mark Alexander Valley Cabs, but in a good way, with a streak of red cherries, tobacco and sandalwood. Fine now with a good steak.",88,25,California
83500,Italy,"This is a creamy and layered wine (made with the Grecanico variety) that offers pretty aromas of banana nut, exotic fruit, chestnut honey and mature notes of melon and stone fruit. The wine is naturally rich with generous flavors and good length.",86,11,Sicily & Sardinia
83510,Australia,White pepper and dill scents make up a promising beginning and lead to a velvety palate with plenty of roasted meat and black cherry fruit. A fine choice with barbecue. Drink now to 2010.,86,13,South Australia
83520,Chile,"Slightly oxidized on the nose, this is low on fruit aromas but not unappealing. A plump palate offers flavors of corn, banana and melon. Firm acidity keeps this pumping on the finish.",86,15,Casablanca Valley
83530,Portugal,"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an immediately attractive wine. Melon, pear and apricots come together in a fruit cocktail of a lively, crisp texture. Drink now.",85,12,Alentejano
83540,Portugal,"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. Smooth and lightly textured, its unusual blend of Pinot Noir, Shiraz and Castel?o is generous and spicy with good final acidity. Drink now.",85,9,Lisboa
83550,Italy,"Aromas of toasted oak, mocha and a whiff of coconut oak lead the nose while the firm palate offers dark cherry, espresso, dried sage and a hint of anise. The tightly wound tannins still pack youthful sharpness and need a few more years to soften up. Drink after 2021.",90,90,Piedmont
83560,Italy,"Rose, red berry, mint and anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, anisette and a mocha note framed in bracing tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2020??031.",90,29,Piedmont
83570,US,"Toast, iodine, steel and kumquat-skin aromas show on this bottling from one of the region's older properties. The palate offers stone fruit ripeness but is driven by a sharp, citrusy acidity of Meyer lemon and Mexican lime.",90,48,California
83580,US,"Aromas like raspberry and fresh bread, and flavors that are fresh, bright and fruity make this dry wine refreshing. The effervescence is soft but the balance seems steely and the body not too heavy.",87,20,California
83590,US,"The winery's larger-production blend of several vineyard sources, given 20 months in American oak, this wine opens in pungent earth, soy and mushroom, reminiscent of a beef bouillon or beef stew. Big tannins surround the fruit, accented in black licorice and black coffee before finishing lean.",87,38,California
83600,New Zealand,"This is a simply, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc that finishes clean and refreshing. It's medium in weight, with bold, food-friendly flavors of white grapefruit.",87,15,Marlborough
83610,Italy,"The nose is rather neutral save for distant aromas of cherry fruit, boysenberry and spice. However, the mouthfeel is more interesting thanks to the wine's chewy succulence and fresh, zesty close: An 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot.",86,18,Tuscany
83620,Italy,"This wine offers an unusual combination of hot, jammy fruit backed by crisp acidity. Its aromas are big and bulky yet the mouthfeel is surprisingly fresh. Pair this wine with roasted duck or other fatty meats.",86,,Tuscany
83630,US,"The second Syrah in the Collaboration Series, this was aged in 30% new puncheons, and opens with a potent, roasted nose. Espresso and cacao flavors dominate the tart, acidic berry fruit, with a lick of lemon verbena running through the finish.",90,60,Washington
83640,US,"This highly accessible, reasonably priced Chardonnay sees no new oak. It offers aromatics of orange blossom and fresh-squeezed lemon followed by a lean texture of more lemon, honeysuckle and melon. Stock up.",90,25,California
83650,Portugal,"The ripe fruit of this Shiraz and Touriga Nacional blend exude a character of richness and sophistication. Dusty tannins provide the framework for red fruit flavors and the generous structure. From José Luís Santos Lima Oliveira da Silva's range, the wine would be best after 2015.",90,15,Lisboa
83660,France,"Light fruit, dwelling on bitter cherry and fresh raspberry flavors. The wine shows crisp acidity, tight tannins and a cool feel.",86,29,Burgundy
83670,Chile,"A bulky wine with aromas of dried herbs, pepper and black fruits. It's meaty and thick in the mouth, with grapey, herbal flavors. Unfolds fairly nicely on the finish, with the wine's herbal character locking in. A good example of Chilean Malbec that's more basic than complex.",86,12,Colchagua Valley
83680,US,"Biscuit, burnt toast, and a hint of rubber dominate the nose. The fruit is light and somewhat buried—a little melon, unripe peach and pineapple. Perhaps too much barrel exposure, or over-toasted barrels?",85,20,Washington
83690,US,"All cherry and sawdust upfront, backed up by a bed of velvety tannins. Vanilla and char notes dominate the palate while some berry-intense flavor comes through on the crisp finish. A year in the cellar would allow for some needed integration.",85,29,Virginia
83700,US,"Aromatic and fruity, this is front-loaded with pretty accents of toast and baking spices. There's 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, but it's Merlot's show, with forward, smooth, chocolaty goodness around a core of raspberry candy.",89,17,Washington
83710,France,"A pure line of fruitiness dominates this wine. Ripe wild strawberry flavors are in charge with acidity giving an attractive sharp edge. The wine is round, full in the mouth,  rich at the end.",89,25,Provence
83720,US,"This remains quite tight, almost shuttered, with boysenberry fruit and sharp acidity. Hints of composted earth and somewhat tarry tannins may be attributed to the addition of 8% Malbec in the blend.",89,35,Washington
83730,France,"A rich wine, bone dry, its red currant fruits cutting through the creamy mousse. It's a serious rosé, with some tannins, spice, very textured and worth aging for a few months in bottle to bring out its incipient toastiness.",90,,Loire Valley
83740,Spain,This barrel-fermented Viura shows toasty popcorn aromas that are derived directly from oak. The palate has a woody personality with tight acidity and flavors that suggest Burgundian Chardonnay. Baked apple and vanilla notes come in front of a long finish.,89,32,Northern Spain
83750,US,"There's a fleshy quality to this Cabernet that makes the term fluffy appropriate. It's rich and dry, with voluptuous flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, as well as a touch of umami, dark chocolate and smoked meat. The tannins are fairly potent, suggesting 5?? years in the cellar.",92,45,California
83760,France,"Intense and rich wine, with touches of smoky wood, the tannins ripe, the acidity a refreshing balancing factor. With its cherry character, there is fruit already, but wait a year and this will be impressive.",91,18,Beaujolais
83770,US,"A fruity, spicy, vibrant Pinot Noir, easy to like for its richness, yet balanced and elegant, if a little direct in its appeal. It shows jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, with hints of cola and anisette liqueur and a sweet coating of sandalwood. Drink it now.",91,68,California
83780,France,"A savory hint of soy sauce spices the citrus hints on the nose. The palate is dry and reveals deeper fruit of yellow mirabelle plum and ripe apple. The dosage is restrained and the mousse is fine, all making for an elegant, fruit-driven fizz of rounded freshness.",89,25,Alsace
83790,US,"This rich and relatively soft block-designated wine has a lighter-than-usual color, a rich, buttery aroma and jammy flavors that recall strawberries and plums. It's a smooth variation on the often tannic and restrained personality of Sangiovese.",89,29,California
83800,US,"Subtle in aroma, this is nevertheless a luxurious wine that offers Anjou pear, honeydew melon and a touch of honey in the flavors. It has a wonderfully smooth texture and apparent sweetness on the finish.",89,16,California
83810,US,"A strong black-pepper character on the nose of this bottling by veteran Rick Longoria also works dark elderberries and a woody spice into the aromatic mix. It's tightly wound and very young on the palate, where blackberry paste, black plum and roasted fennel barely peek out. The firm structure will reveal much more spice and fruit in the future. Drink 2018??034.",93,50,California
83820,US,"Cropped down to just 1.5 tons/acre, with firm acidity and lovely floral aromatics, this elegant wine piles up refined notes of citrus, stone fruits and brambly berries. The aging in one-third new oak adds hints of toasted hazelnuts, caramel latte and sea salt chocolate. The finish has a lightly waxy sheen.",93,55,Oregon
83830,France,"From the excellent 2008 vintage, this is a very complete, ripe wine. It is rich, packed with crisp white fruits that are developing into a structured, concentrated wine with a great future. The balance between acidity and dosage is just right. Drink ideally from 2018.",93,42,Champagne
83840,US,"A soft, simple wine, with cherry cough medicine flavors.",81,10,California
83850,Spain,"Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.",80,14,Northern Spain
83860,Portugal,"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol??thanks to the D?o's mountain climate and granite soil. Pape is a top wine from Alvaro Castro made predominantly from Touriga Nacional. Perfumed, elegant and structured, with plenty of concentration, this is a wine for serious aging.",95,65,D?o
83870,France,"Rounded and honeyed, this is a wine that shows a sweeter side of Pinot Blanc, buoyed by fresh, juicy white-peach flavor. Full, rich and dense, this is fruity, yet it has a complex structure.",89,24,Alsace
83880,France,"This is rich and concentrated, spice as well as pear and melon flavors. It is complex, with almond and nutmeg notes, balanced by the taut acidity that completes a full, ripe wine.",89,24,Alsace
83890,France,"It's deep garnet in color, made solely from Muscat à Petits Grains Noir, with unique aromas reminscent of pomegranate and cherry, and a slightly peppery note. Medium-bodied and silky in texture, it has a long finish that hints at leather, earth and cocoa.",89,30,Rh?ne Valley
83900,US,"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done.",83,14,California
83910,US,"This Cabernet is a bit on the green side, with sharp, slightly bitter tannins that are not completely masked by the overlay of chocolatey barrel flavors.",83,24,Oregon
83920,Spain,"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",83,14,Northern Spain
83930,Italy,"Intensely fragrant, this beautiful, vibrant wine offers enticing scents of iris, violet, rose and perfumed wild berry. It's elegantly structured and loaded with finesse, offering cherry, strawberry, crushed herb, coffee and white pepper alongside taut refined tannins. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity. Give it time to fully unwind and develop even more complexity.",95,90,Piedmont
83940,US,"An abundance of chaparral spice adds intrigue to the nose of this bottling by veteran Ken Brown. Dried sage and a eucalyptus-like menthol character decorate the red currant and raspberry core. Pine needles play prominently on the palate, giving depth to the cranberry, pomegranate and white-pepper flavors. It offers tons of flair, but also elegance.",95,60,California
83950,US,"This is a Pinot Noir for lovers of lush expressions. Fat black cherry meets with nutmeg, vanilla, clove, raw meat and leather on the nose. Juicy blackberries and black currant explode on the sip, alongside sandalwood and myrrh. It's super rich and a tad sweet but also lively with persistent acidity.",94,68,California
83960,US,"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat.",87,25,California
83970,Australia,"The aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistake—this is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.",87,30,Western Australia
83980,US,"From one of the older Pinot Noir vineyards in the valley. There's nothing shy about the aromas or flavors. It's got tomato, coffee, mushroom, black- and red-raspberry and peppery-spicy notes that last into the finish. Silky tannins and mild acids make it immediately drinkable.",87,26,California
83990,US,"Fresh and crisp on the nose, this lively and laser-sharp wine shows grapefruit skin and pith, Gala apple and cut grass scents on the nose. That grassy element grows more prevalent on the sip, accenting tarter lime peel flavors.",88,26,California
84000,US,"A dark core of black plum, blueberry and violet marks the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate showcases purple fruit and floral notes, with concentrated black plum skin and more violet leading the way.",88,35,California
84010,US,"Cooked plums and cherries meet with dill, tarragon, cola and asphalt on the nose of this wine. Rocky flavors of tar and pencil shavings meld with Dr Pepper elements, cedar and more cooked fruit on the palate.",88,52,California
84020,Portugal,"This wine is dry and structured, with fresh acidity. It is perfumed by red berry and cherry aromas and an attractive touch of spice. The aftertaste is crisp, light and fruity, ending sweet.",88,,Port
84030,Italy,"Delicate scents of yellow fruit and acacia flower float from the glass. The vibrant palate offers green apple, lemon and lime framed in bracing acidity and a firm, persistent perlage.",88,22,Veneto
84040,US,"Very dry and tannic, a somewhat austere wine. But it has a deep core of blackberries and black currants along with a meatiness, like charred beef off the grill. Interesting and complex, for slow sipping with complex beef, pork and lamb dishes.",91,30,California
84050,France,"The attractive presentation, with handwriting directly on to the bottle, is followed by an equally attractive wine, ripe and full in character, but balanced with good acidity. There is a final vanilla burst.",90,24,Provence
84060,Italy,There's slight sweetness here in the form of soft oak elements that glide easily together with the natural fruitiness and freshness of Barbera. There's nice personality and dimension and the wine is smooth and soft on the finish (save for that prickly touch of acidity you should expect).,90,25,Piedmont
84070,Italy,"This is an easy, informal Chardonnay that offers measured intensity and aromas of peach, melon and citrus followed by a waxy, almost sweet sensation in the mouth. Drink it on a hot summer afternoon.",85,,Northeastern Italy
84080,Italy,"There's a strong mineral vein that runs through this luminous Traminer Aromatico that takes attention away from its fruity, floral bouquet. The wine is, however, fresh and vibrant in the mouth and ends with bursting fruit.",85,15,Northeastern Italy
84090,US,"This is made from equal proportions of ripe, fleshy Merlot and herbaceous, violet-inflected Cabernet Franc. The resulting blend is brisk in acidity and framed with hints of cedar, baking spice and vanilla. It's robust with tannins but should round out with braised meat or other hearty fare.",86,20,New York
84100,Greece,"Anise, blackberry, black pepper and savory spice aromas lead this ripe red from Pavlidis. The palate is laced with a vanilla note, and the red berry flavors are rich and easy to like. With its good spice and complex fruit, this should pair well with grilled meats and tomato pastas.",86,30,Drama
84110,Greece,"Alluring aromas of exotic fruit and citrus are followed by equally lush flavors throughout: think pineapple, lemon curd and even banana. Intriguing and fun, but not overly complex.",86,23,Pangeon
84120,Italy,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is vinified in steel and bottle aged. It's young and fresh, boasting bright red cherry and raspberry sensations along with notes of freshly tilled earth.",87,19,Tuscany
84130,France,"This is a smooth and soft wine with attractive white-fruit aromas and bold acidity. It's finely textured with juicy, fresh apple and pear flavors. It is ready to drink now, but will age over the medium term.",87,32,Burgundy
84140,US,"Though labeled merlot, this is truly a Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (6%), Malbec (5%), and Petit Verdot (2%) added to the mix. It is reserved in style with notes of cherry, dried herbs and pickling spices backed by firm, dry tannins.",87,20,Oregon
84150,Germany,"Delicate aromas of herb and white peach stand in contrast to the ripe, almost candied yellow peach and mango flavors on the palate of this medium-sweet Riesling. It's juicy and lip smacking but spry and crisp on the finish. Drink now to enjoy its youthful freshness.",89,12,Mosel
84160,US,"This blend of 50% Sémillon, 30% Sauvignon Blanc Clone 1 and 20% Sauvignon Musqué from Monte Rosso and Leveroni vineyards was aged in French oak. Succulent as a peach, it's intensely ripe and flavorful, with vanilla bean and melon notes and a wisp of sweetness.",89,46,California
84170,France,"From a single parcel of organically grown Pinot Blanc, this was partially vinified in wood. It is dry, although the fruitiness of the grapes balances that dryness. The result is a rich wine, full of fruitiness and with a toasty edge that adds complexity. Drink now.",89,50,Champagne
84180,France,"Hugely liquorous wine, full of honey, superripe fruit, yellow peach and apricot flavors, along with orange marmalade. This is big, very densely flavored, richly textured. It could certainly age for 5??0 years.",88,24,Bordeaux
84190,Spain,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",88,18,Northern Spain
84200,Italy,"Red berry aromas and cherry and candied fruit are backed by spice, horsehide and tobacco. The mouthfeel is thinner, streamlined and still a bit raw.",88,18,Tuscany
84210,US,"Strong oaky, smoky, peppery aromas and flavors define this robust, assertive, high-alcohol wine. It will appeal to some consumers more than others, and those who like lots of seasoning on their steak will love it.",89,60,California
84220,US,"This full-bodied wine has a deep color and smoke and charcoal aromas. The flavors are ripe, concentrated, grapy and berry-like. The texture has moderate tannins but is polished around the edges. It's a big and rowdy wine that doesn't lose control.",89,16,California
84230,Italy,"Exotic spice, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. The palate is rather austere, showing dried berry, spearmint, ground pepper and wild herb alongside aggressive tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink up.",88,75,Southern Italy
84240,England,"A restrained but pure note of lemon constitutes the nose, suggesting both tangy zest and juicy flesh. The subtle mousse of tiny bubbles and a sonorous backdrop of autolysis counters all of this freshness and allows it to blanket the senses with its shimmering, lemony but also creamy briskness. That luminous lemon core leaves a lasting impression on the palate. Purity, slenderness and elegance are its hallmarks. Lovely now this wine will age with grace. Drink 2017??025.",94,80,England
84250,US,"Blended with 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is treated as a reserve-tier bottling. It delivers high-toned red fruit and plum notes dusted with spice and dried herb. It's robust in body and weight and long on the finish.",93,100,California
84260,France,"A tender but perfumed hint of honeysuckle appears first on the nose, followed by rich peach hints. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuous—perfect for blue cheeses.",93,35,Alsace
84270,US,"Longtime growers, most notably to Schramsberg, which still gets the majority of the grapes, the Tognettis have just begun to make wine of their own, and this one is stellar. Classic barrel tones give it depth and breadth, but never dominate, allowing juicy pear and spicy lemon acidity to do all the talking.",94,55,California
84280,Italy,"Structured and delicious, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, leather rose petal and a balsamic note. The juicy palate doles out raspberry compote, ripe red cherry, cinnamon and a sprinkling of white pepper. Firm velvety tannins provide the framework while a licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2019??025.",94,60,Piedmont
84290,US,"This vineyard-designate rocks its way into your heart, opening in spicy, soft aromas of cinnamon stick and dark, luscious fruit and toasted oak. Medium in body with a light finish, it teases along the way in fragrant rose petals and orange blossom.",93,45,California
84300,US,"Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout.",88,35,California
84310,US,"This full-bodied, focused and distinctive wine has a deep, dark color, aromas of black cherry and cocoa, and flavors that are ripe and lingering. It offers power and complexity.",88,18,California
84320,Italy,"Aromas of raisin, vanilla, nutmeg, peppermint and a whiff of resin lead the nose of this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. The easy-drinking palate delivers crushed black cherries, black currants, clove and chocolate covered mint alongside supple tannins.",88,21,Tuscany
84330,Portugal,"Grown on the plateau above the Douro valley, this wine is rich, generous and finely balanced. Green plum and citrus acidity are dominant, while ripe melon and spice grace the finish. Drink now.",86,13,Douro
84340,US,"This soft, simple wine, with small touches of Malbec and Petit Verdot, delivers sizable tannin atop notable acidity. Tart red currant and cherry meet cedar and a taste of toffee, allowing for a pleasantness on the palate that's rich and ripe.",86,23,California
84350,Spain,"Gritty, earthy berry aromas lack refinement. This wine has a narrow, blocky mouthfeel and salty flavors of baked plum and carob. That same roasted, salty character carries over onto the finish.",86,10,Northern Spain
84360,Chile,"Minty and smelling of sawdust on the nose. This is oaky for a $10 wine, with berry aromas and flavors touched up by green notes, resiny oak and milk chocolate. The finish tastes herbal and feels chewy.",84,10,Curicó Valley
84370,US,"A simple, proper Pinot Noir, dry and silky in the mouth. It shows modest raspberry and cherry flavors, with an edge of oak.",84,13,California
84380,US,"The climate of New Mexico seems to suit the Viognier grape. Here it has given it a lovely, intense perfume of gardenia, orange blossom and guava. Though broad and soft in the mouth, enough acid comes through on the finish to save it from flabbiness. Serve as an apéritif.",86,20,New Mexico
84390,France,"There are plenty of dry tannins here, dominating light red berry and hedgerow fruits. It is never going to be a big wine, but the tannins should soften in a year to leave a fresh, fruity wine.",86,47,Burgundy
84400,US,"Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar. Some modest blackberry flavors, which turn into black currants and cocoa toward the finish, relieve the austerity. But it doesn't seem likely to improve.",86,40,California
84410,US,"Given time to ferment slowly in large oak casks, this wine offers golden color and a taste of baked apple and lemon pie. Tart in minerality, it's also fulsome in body and weight, finding a balance between flavor and buoyancy. It finishes with length and breadth.",90,60,California
84420,Israel,"Deep ruby in the glass, this aptly-named wine has a nose of black cherry and aniseed. Slightly grippy tannins and strong acidity stand at the core of blueberry, raspberry, anisette and peppermint flavors. Touches of mint and orange zest make an impression on the taste buds well into the enduring finish.",90,25,Upper Galilee
84430,Portugal,"The wood aging is still showing in the aroma of the wine. On the palate, the fruitiness of the blend of Ant?o Vaz, Arinto and Viognier comes across richly with flavors of apricots, green plums and pink grapefruit. This fruitiness is layered over the wood spice to give a creamy wine that will age. Drink from 2017.",90,25,Alentejano
84440,US,Very juicy aromas of blueberry pie with a buttered crust and vanilla ice cream bring great promise to this Malbec. It carries through with a very round and broad mouthfeel and rich plum flavors with cracked black pepper. The tannins are a tad astringent.,87,30,California
84450,France,"Ripe and full of fruit, the wine also has a firmer tannic structure that gives concentration. The rich cherry and red plum fruits show strongly through the drier core, adding their rounded feel and contrasting with the acidity that comes through at the end.",87,18,Beaujolais
84460,US,"Sunny and tart like a bushel of Maraschino cherries, this is a zippy, delicately composed Syrah. It's fresh and primary on the palate, with bristling cranberry acidity that drives a long, lean finish.",87,25,New York
84470,US,"Mostly Merlot with a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (11%), this wine hails from Bacchus, Ciel du Cheval and Elephant Mountain vineyards. It's immediately appealing, with aromas of toasty spices, herbs and red fruit followed by plump but well-balanced fruit flavors.",90,25,Washington
84480,US,"This producer shows its aptitude for whites with this dry, estate-grown effort, a bit cloudy thanks to the lack of fining and filtering. A touch of grass is on the nose, but then it's all rich, vanilla-laden texture and pear, the body medium and the wine lengthy and in balance.",90,26,California
84490,US,"Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal.",90,18,Washington
84500,Italy,"Yeasty aromas of bread crust, yellow apple, candied lemon and nectarine peel carry over to the palate alongside an elegant perlage. Made with no added dosage, it finishes crisp and bone-dry with a quenching close.",91,55,Lombardy
84510,US,"Lush, fruit-forward aromas of watermelon pudding and bubblegum make for a pink wine that engages on many levels. Ripe, soft fruit flavors match well with the almost gritty acidity. A delicious and refreshing sleection to drink now.",91,38,California
84520,US,"Walla Walla Valley Barbera is rare, although this producer consistently makes one. Its toasty spice, tart cherry and herb aromas give way to well-balanced plum and cherry flavors, needing food to truly shine.",88,29,Washington
84530,US,"This wine has notes of mint and crisp apple in the aroma and flavors that resemble peach and ripe apple so it balances the more tangy first impression with a richer feel on the palate. It's medium bodied, not too big and not too lean.",88,16,California
84540,US,"This vintage marks the winery's 45th anniversary making this wine, a feat of historic proportion. Maintaining a fair price, it offers lime, lemon and grapefruit within bristling, buzzing acidity. The texture is thick and refined. Balanced, it's dry and refreshing.",88,15,California
84550,Australia,"This is a pretty traditional example of Barossa Shiraz, with oak-derived elements of vanilla, chocolate and a touch of dill backed by bold blackberry and deep cherry fruit. It's round and full on the palate, with a finish that fades easily into dusty notes of espresso and cocoa. Drink now??020.",89,17,South Australia
84560,US,"Though just two years past fermentation, this is already taking on a mature hue with hints of bricking around the rim. It's soft, smooth and lightly toasty, a blend of rose water and wild raspberry flavors that have the precision and elegance to impress. Though light and low in alcohol, it's a well-made, true-to-variety style.",89,25,Oregon
84570,France,"The domaine owns 12 acres in this premier cru. This wine has a touch of honey and toast, as well as a tight texture. The fruit dominates, along with the freshest acidity, while the aftertaste shows a crunchy apple character. Drink from 2016.",89,,Burgundy
84580,Italy,"Forest floor, ripe black fruit, truffle, leather and balsamic aromas open this bold, concentrated wine. The delicious palate offers layers of blackberry, spicy plum, black pepper, cassis and savory herb alongside big, velvety tannins. It has balance and depth but it's still young and needs time to develop complexity. Drink 2018??030.",94,55,Central Italy
84590,Germany,"While the nose is buoyant, bursting with honey, mango and flowers, a polished elegance reverberates throughout this dry, steely Riesling. Rich in body and texture, it's ripe and peachy, yet balanced with streaks of lime, lemon and mineral. The finish rolls endlessly on the palate.",94,80,Rheinhessen
84600,US,"Winemaker Jesse Katz pulled out all the stops to craft this small-production Malbec, proving that the right fruit in the right hands can yield crazy-good results. Having spent time aging in 100% new French oak, the wine needs time to open, but once it does, look out. Concentrated swirls of wild blackberry and truffle are framed by soft tannins and measured acidity. Drink now through 2024, easily.",94,80,California
84610,US,"This compelling and distinctive wine is redolent with scents and flavors of sweet cherry and pipe tobacco. It punches up the palate and tickles the nostrils. Crafted from old vine Pommard (planted in 1973 and 1984) and cropped down to three-quarters of a ton per acre, this spent 14 months in 20% new French oak. It's one of those Pinots that requires your full attention.",93,65,Oregon
84620,France,"This very complete wine displays a fine balance between its tannins, black fruits and acidity. The structure is firm, still dry while giving space for the developing fruitiness. It is almost ready to drink, although it will be better from 2016.",93,24,Southwest France
84630,US,"This new vintage of Caitlin's Reserve was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It went through regular lees stirring and a generally traditional Burgundian élévage. Trim and compact, it remains up to the taster to forecast how well this will age, and how much complexity is locked within it. Based upon the wine's track record, there's every reason to put away a few bottles to drink in the mid-2020s.",92,45,Oregon
84640,US,"A solid, good Cabernet, with very ripe, extracted blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little forward and obvious now, and will take a few years of cellaring.",88,60,California
84650,US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Pepper Bridge vineyard; now with several extra years in bottle. It's drinking well at five years of age, with strawberry and cherry fruit, bracing acidity and chalky, highly astringent tannins. The finish brings in leaf, pepper and coffee grounds.",88,48,Washington
84660,France,"Darker in color than many Provence rosés, this caramel-flavored wine has a fine line in ripe berry fruits to go with the smooth, velvet texture. Dry in style, its firm texture is right for food.",88,11,Provence
84670,Italy,"Rich spice and beautiful balsam notes of cherry cola and root beer set the stage for what is a compelling Chianti Classico with good intensity and staying power. The wine has a chewy, rich texture with long-lasting notes of bursting cherry.",88,,Tuscany
84680,Portugal,"Even after five years, this wine still shows its primary fruit—black plums, sweet but structured. Callabriga, a Tinta Roriz based wine, goes light on the acidity, but the tannins and the hints of vanilla balance well with the blackberry jam fruits.",88,30,Douro
84690,South Africa,"This is a classic red blend, with its lovely nose of pepper, spice and dark berry, and its clean, integrated spice and fruit character. Restrained but flavorful, it's a great go-to red for any meal.",88,27,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch
84700,US,"This wine's aromas display a mixture of fruit and barrel, with notes of vanilla, coconut shavings and plum. The flavors are the same, silky and elegant, with barrel flavors lingering on the finish. It's a very stylistic wine.",89,35,Washington
84710,Argentina,"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas show a note of graphite. In the mouth, this Cab is rocky and hard, with crusty cheek-sucking tannins. Herb-infused black-fruit flavors of cassis and blackberry finish oaky, chocolaty and minty, with biting, hard tannins.",88,18,Mendoza Province
84720,US,"There's a very likable umami character to the nose of this wine, its soy and black pepper touches playing well with the lilac and dark fruit aromas. A blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Petit Verdot, 17% Malbec, 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot, it offers bright blackberry and black cherry flavors on the palate, which transition to soy and sarsaparilla notes on the finish.",88,75,California
84730,France,"This Merlot-dominated blend has resulted in a wine that is both juicy and structured. With its forward flavor of black currant juice, it is surprisingly ready to drink, although the tannins also promise aging. It's ripe and dense, while the final acidity offers a fresh finish",88,37,Bordeaux
84740,France,"Very dense and tannic, this wine is hiding its fruit behind its firm structure. It is solid, chunky and powerful, with plenty of weight that will always be dry. Needs to age for several years.",88,30,Bordeaux
84750,Italy,"Green apple, flint and apricot are some of the aromas of this elegant, medium-bodied white. The smooth palate offers layers of juicy white peach, Mediterranean herb and mineral alongside refreshing acidity.",89,27,Central Italy
84760,US,"The winery's second release coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this wine is still in its shell, with brooding aromas of raspberries and blackberries, fresh thyme, savory herbs and tobacco. Blackberry and cherry flavors are lighter in style, backed by a wall of tannins that at present permits no entry. The wine needs significant time in the cellar to reveal it possibilities. Best after 2020.",89,35,Washington
84770,France,This wine is named after the mountain that dominates the west of the C?tes de Provence vineyards and gives an extra-rich dimension to the wines. It is structured and full of ripe red fruits and tangerines along with a touch of vanilla.,89,17,Provence
84780,US,"Blended with 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Viognier, this is an impressive offering with notes of smoke, vanilla, spice, and smoked meat. It's light in style, silky soft in feel without an ounce of extra alcoholic fat to weigh it down.",90,13,Idaho
84790,Austria,"Lifted green pears, ripe lemon rind and yellow plums make for a fruity trio. The supple palate radiates substance and style.",89,,Nieder?sterreich
84800,France,"Made by the team from Ch?teau Chasse-Spleen, this elegant, smooth wine has deceptively firm tannins. The wine is dense, structured with plenty of juicy black currant fruits to balance. It will age, so don't drink before 2018.",89,22,Bordeaux

84820,France,"Produced from vines mainly planted in the 1970s, this is a concentrated dark wine. Rich and ripe, it has powerful tannins mingled with beautifully perfumed fruits. The wine is dense and packed with floral fruitiness as well as fine, sweet tannins. Drink from 2025.",95,973,Burgundy
84830,US,"This is a tremendously, remarkably and memorably bright and tangy wine, floral on the nose and delicious on the palate. Blood orange, lithe minerality and sparks of lemon and lime highlight the experience, the grapes grown on Atlas Peak.",94,42,California
84840,US,"Grape-jam aromas and ripe, sweet flavors make this wine attractive in its easygoing, accessible style. For a deep, dark red, it has a surprisingly soft, velvety texture and a mild amount of sugar.",86,14,California
84850,Italy,"Aromas of new leather and menthol segue into the brooding palate along with dried cherry and a note of medicinal herb. It's tightly tannic, with a lean astringent finish.",86,21,Piedmont
84860,US,"Robust in oak, this full-bodied expression of the variety is reduced on the palate, showing sizable tannin weight and length. Plum, dark cherry and dried herb combine to offer swirls of flavor.",86,45,California
84870,US,"A proprietary blend of Zinfandel and Malbec, with smaller parts Merlot, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, Heritage is powerful and soft. It's awash in blueberry, red plum and vanilla, all verging on superripe, the finish particularly intense.",88,30,California
84880,France,"A wine that is, unusually for Bordeaux, dominated by Sémillon. That gives a creamy, ripe and still muted character and demands another few years aging. The acidity and fresh citrus fruits are filled out with melon and ripe pear flavors. Drink this wine from 2016.",88,25,Bordeaux
84890,US,"This is certainly dry, as stated, but it doesn't have the texture and stuffing that the best dry Rieslings bring to the show. Simple and straightforward lemon and grapefruit flavors tell the whole story, and those high acids leave a sour impression.",86,19,Oregon
84900,Italy,"This wine's delicate pear, apple and beeswax aromas carry over to the simple, enjoyable palate, along with a citrus note. It's refreshing, with bright acidity.",86,10,Veneto
84910,US,"The aromas are somewhat underripe, with notes of herb, thistle and medicine cabinet. The cranberry and cherry flavors seem more dried out than its age would indicate.",86,29,Washington
84920,Spain,"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",90,25,Northern Spain
84930,Italy,"I Quaranta has succeeded in fashioning a thoroughly modern, lush style of wine from an eclectic blend of 60% Barbera and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of mocha back up dense plum and strawberry fruit on the nose which give way to a refined palate showcasing highly polished tannins. A final kick of acidity adds freshness to the deep chocolate and cassis flavors that linger on the finish.",90,,Piedmont
84940,US,"Dark, soft and delicious, this Syrah has extremely complex flavors. They range from blackberries and black currants to chocolate, anise, bacon, black pepper, violets, and an edge of smoky sandalwood. Drink this bone dry wine now.",90,20,California
84950,US,"Exhaling honey-vanilla in the glass, it gives off a hint of sweetness on the quick finish. Midpalate, expect fleshy apricot and white peach flavors. Enjoy on a summer's day with spicy peanuts.",86,15,California
84960,US,"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.",86,24,California
84970,France,"A fragrant, fresh rosé that is full of red fruits and tight acidity. Crisp and bright, it makes a delicious summer refresher. Drink now.",86,30,Loire Valley
84980,Portugal,"This is marked by bold, dense and rich fruit. It has a sweet, soft character and is deliciously fruity. Packed with blackberry-juice acidity and ripe red plum, this is ready to drink now.",88,18,Alentejano
84990,US,"This pleasing effort is light but interesting. It first introduces flavors of strawberry and rhubarb, with a dash of pepper. A whiff of root vegetables does not interfere with the overall enjoyment, and a lick of chocolate lifts the finish.",88,45,Oregon
85000,US,"From the fine Spring Mountain appellation, this has sweet-and-sour flavors of apricots, pineapples and brown sugar.",82,29,California
85010,US,"Soft and dull, this has medicinal, cough drop flavors of berry fruit.",81,10,California
85020,France,"A very fresh, very crisp wine that has initially shocking acidity. Then, as it opens up, more subtle apple and citrus fruits appear, keeping the cool character of the wine while adding more complexity.",86,24,France Other
85030,US,"This dry, light-footed Riesling offers savory notes of bruised apple and walnut skin. It's refreshingly breezy on the palate with streaks of lemon acidity, and finishes crisp and clean.",86,25,New York
85040,Chile,"Citrus and green herb with a prickle control the nose. Mixed citrus, passion fruit and arugula are the main flavors, and they are backed by matchstick bitterness, citric acid and sulfur on the finish.",86,12,Central Valley
85050,Australia,"Tumbarumba is an up-and-coming cool-climate viticulture region, and this Chardonnay is a fine example of why the area is considered to have promise. The wine is medium in body and nicely plump in the mouth, and displays a harmonious blend of apple, pear, citrus and butter flavors and an elegant, lingering finish. Drink now and over the next 1?? years.",89,30,New South Wales
85060,Australia,"Full bodied and supple, this nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that value still exists even in big-name regions of Australia. Intense blueberry and spice aromas give way to mixed berries and vanilla on the palate, and if it's not overly complex, it's a still a concentrated mouthful of Shiraz at a bargain price.",89,13,South Australia
85070,US,"Sourced from excellent Yakima Valley sites, fermented in stainless steel, and ripened perfectly to 13.5% alcohol, this juicy, fresh, fruit-laden wine captures the ideal mix of snappy citrus and luscious stone fruits. Delicious.",89,11,Washington
85080,US,"A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1?? years.",89,85,California
85090,Portugal,"This is an elegant wine, with balanced fruit and tannins that make for a soft texture. It is rich and laced with fresh, raspberry-like acidity. It can age for another year, but it is also ready to drink.",89,10,Tejo
85100,US,"This Chardonnay is dry, with vibrant acidity and tangy, mineral-infused flavors of stone and earth. It shows subtle notes of Meyer lemons, limes and tangerines. Don't drink this too cold.",89,22,California
85110,US,"Primarily Syrah, this was barrel aged in 40% new French and American oak––surprising at this price. Complex and layered, with dark berries, licorice, coffee liqueur and roasted meat. Though lighter than many Washington Syrahs, at less than half the price it captures the essence of the grape, with a citrusy finish.",88,13,Washington
85120,US,"An interesting interpretation of Sangiovese. It's dry and quite high in acidity, with a tart mouthfeel framing intense flavors of cherries, tobacco, red licorice and tingly pepperspice. The texture is as light and delicate as a Pinot Noir. Drink now.",88,40,California
85130,New Zealand,"Reminiscent of a good Crozes-Hermitage, Paritua's '07 Syrah displays bold aromas of smoke, espresso, cracked pepper and blackberries.

Toffee and warm cobbler aromas start it off and lead to a textured, elegant palate with toasty, nutty flavors and a pinch of salt. The finish is robust, and at all points it's a take-charge wine. An amontillado for connoisseurs and anyone eager to enjoy the finer points of the style.",92,42,Andalucia
85150,Italy,"Seductive and irresistible, Campo del Drago offers abundant density, richness and flavor. This hearty Brunello is bursting with cherries, blueberries, spice and milk chocolate. It's a modern, hedonistic wine with chewy density and a smooth, creamy texture.",92,75,Tuscany
85160,US,"This wine is heady in apple blossom and jasmine, deeply honeyed in color with an accompanying taste of honey and apple. Big on the nose, it impresses in surprising ways by being quite lean and well integrated on the palate, with a lingering heft of juicy ripeness on the finish.",94,60,California
85170,Italy,"Fragrant and elegantly structured, this radiant red offers scents fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and wild berry. The structured palate offers ripe red cherry, orange peel, cake spice and star anise alongside a backbone of assertive but polished tannins. Drink 2022??032.",94,100,Piedmont
85180,Austria,"An earthy dimension still clings to the zesty notes on the nose but on the palate a whole load of citrus flavors are expressed without strain: For now, lemon and the tangy zest of tangerine carry everything on this slender but concentrated wine to a glorious, totally refreshing finish.

85220,Italy,"This is a powerful bully of a wine but a good value in the pricey Barolo category. Sweaty, masculine aromas lead to a concentrated palate framed by strapping tannins and flavors of black earth and violets. Medium finish. Give it a few years to grow up.",88,16,Piedmont
85230,US,"A polished, pretty Syrah. It's black in color and very soft, and tastes like a blackberry- and blueberry-infused chocolate drink, with hints of bacon. Luscious and ready to drink now.",88,22,California
85240,US,"Leathery on the palate with sizably structured tannins, this estate-grown wine is robust in black cherry and blackberry, sprinkled subtly in black pepper, tar and coffee.

85260,US,"Great structure meets abundant fruit flavors in this big but well-balanced wine.

While obviously tannic and robust in texture, it seems to melt in the mouth for a smooth and lingering finish.",90,19,California
85270,Australia,"A venture into the deep end of pricing perhaps, but the proof is in the bottle. From vines planted in 1964, this is a rich, full-bodied and creamy-textured wine, with complex notes of smoke, vanilla, plum and roasted meat. Approachable now because of its lushness, it should drink well for at least the next several years.",93,65,South Australia
85280,France,"A fine balance between sweetness, acidity and astringency drives this wine forward. Acidity lifts the palate and adds freshness, and botrytis adds a drying astringency. Pineapples, prunes and apricots all add their fruity notes to this rich wine. Drink from 2018.",93,,Bordeaux

85330,US,"Martini goes big with this flashy, splashy, small-production Cabernet. Made in the modern cult style, it's soft as velvet, with ultrarefined tannins and a brisk hit of acidity for balance, plus flavors of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate.

85390,France,"The top rosé from Minuty is 95% Grenache, and shows a richly spiced nose that's almost musky or feral, balanced by pink grapefruit aromas. It's longer and finer in the mouth than the Cuvée de l'Oratoire, with more pronounced minerality and crisper acids.",89,28,Provence
85400,US,"Hannah vineyard is a select block of Tualatin Estate, and carries the same set of herbal, pine needle aromatics. But the fruit is more intense, with deeper cranberry and raspberry flavors, more weight and a stiffer finish. The time in barrel adds clove and cinnamon to the mix. Tannins are ripe and hard, so give this some extra time to breathe.",89,45,Oregon
85410,US,"This delicious wine is as soft, silky and supple as can be. The fruit is slathered in spicy, chocolaty oak, which lends some sharpness to the edges. Red berries and red licorice lead into finishing flavors of baking chocolate.

85430,Italy,"A barrique-fermented blend of Verdicchio and Chardonnay, Le Busche is the kind of wine you'll want to serve with roast turkey or lasagna with crusty melted cheese.

85470,Germany,"Intense honeysuckle perfume is offset by enticing complexities of mushroom and earth in this sprightly off-dry Riesling.

85520,France,"This wine is all herbal fruits, with spice from the wood-aging and lively acidity. It has considerable potential, full of its nervy texture, minerality and tight acidity. Wait at least into 2020. Tristan and Lo?c Kressmann now run the family estate.",93,35,Bordeaux
85530,US,"This intensely powerful wine is named in honor of the winery's co-proprietor and founder. Chewy and earthy, it's concentrated and robust, strong in black-cherry cola and truffle.

85540,New Zealand,"This is a wild-yeast, barrel-fermented wine that makes one wonder why other producers' versions are so pricey.

85550,US,"Grenache Blanc is a newcomer to the Northwest, and what little exists is rarely offered in a varietal wine. Here it's spicy and phenolic, with sharp definition. Green apple and diverse yellow fruits are in the mix, with a hint of mineral and plenty of bracing acidity.",87,25,Washington
85560,US,"A tart, short, sharp entry leads into raspberry and strawberry flavors, underscored with a light earthiness. The youthful fruit and bright acidity suggests it will show improvement with further bottle age, as the tannins smooth out.",87,23,Washington
85570,France,"A firm and solid wine, tightly packed with tannins, black berry fruits and a dense structure. Laurence is Laurence Helfrich whose family owns the chateau. The wine could age for several years, but will be ready to drink in 2014.",87,15,Bordeaux

Drink now.",92,112,Madeira
85630,France,"A blend from many parcels of the producer's vineyards, this bone-dry wine is crisp and almost tart. Green apple flavors dominate the palate, accented by tight acidity and intense minerality. Like many really dry Champagnes, it needs to be aged and will be best from 2018.",92,95,Champagne
85640,Germany,"This is a blend of 85% Pinot Noir and 15% Lemberger—and yet the Lemberger is the dominant grape. The color is dark, the aromas and flavors are chunky and less nuanced than pure Pinot Noir, and the tannins are ripe but lack the silky character of Pinot. It's a solid, robust red that would make a nice match for burgers and the like.",88,19,Baden

85700,Italy,"Serpico is a bold, larger-than-life wine, with beautiful aromatic intensity and notes of black fruit, espresso and crushed granite. Some 18 months of oak aging adds elements of dark spice and smoke; and the wine shows firm tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. It's very elegant and should withstand many more years of cellar aging.",93,83,Southern Italy
85710,US,"This Syrah was grown and produced by the winery owners, and held back almost five years before release. That's an impressive act of courage, but it has benefited the consumer. The wine, while still somewhat tannic, feels mellow, with a complex array of black fruits and berries, grilled bacon, sweet tobacco, dark chocolate and, above all, freshly crushed black pepper. An impressive Syrah that should change in interesting ways over the next six years.",93,38,California

85760,France,"Ripe rounded aspects of ripe pear and yellow apple play on the nose. The palate has an earthy touch and frothy lively fizz that boosts the fruit notes of the nose. The body is light and dry with a mouth-watering, refreshing finish that echoes long with lovely apple notes.",90,17,Alsace
85770,US,"This larger production offering from the respected producer is a testament to the benefit of sourcing from multiple sites. It showcases an interesting oyster shell note, as well as robust, caramelized oak. Honey and baked apple flavors lend richness and concentration.",90,40,California

85790,Austria,"Subdued, ripe, yellow pear meets yeasty, almost soy-like savoriness head-on to create a palate full of interest. The wine conveys weight, concentration and a bit of alcoholic heat, but it's all carried of with peppery panache. Lovely now but will only get better.",93,41,Kamptal

85820,US,"From the proprietor's 30 acres of the variety, planted to three clones ideally suited for the coolness of the site, this is a relatively light-bodied wine. However it presents a richness and concentration of pineapple and green olive, the oak providing a baked, creamy sensation.",90,35,California
85830,US,"Dense blackberry and blueberry-paste scents mesh with dark chocolate, milk chocolate and graphite on the nose of this bottling from the Hahn family.

85840,France,"This is a ripe and tangy wine from the Bellanger family. Its green, citrus and apricot fruits are all singing together in an attractive, balanced way. It has richness that gives a full-bodied wine without detracting from the fresher, white currant and spice side. Drink now.",90,40,Bordeaux
85850,US,"Darker and richer than Amici's second label (Olema), this is anchored by ripe cassis and chocolate flavors. Cedary oak and minty accents add complexity, while the mouthfeel is velvety soft, finishing with a touch of warmth. Probably best consumed over the next few years.",91,35,California

85900,France,"This is on the weighty side of Chablis, giving a wine that is more Burgundy proper in its richness. That said, there is a good citric element, but the ripeness is more important, underlined by toast.",89,70,Burgundy
85910,US,"What a nice wine for bistro-style drinking. Conjures up pairing with almost everything, from tempura to grilled chicken to pork enchiladas. Bone dry and crisp, it offers outstanding flavors of citrus fruits, petrol, wildflowers, grass, minerals, honey and spices. A blend of Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli and Chenin Blanc.",89,10,California
85920,France,"This ripe and juicy wine is full of black currant fruit. The spice from wood aging is still upfront and needs to integrate. When it does, expect ripe fruit with a fine backdrop of structure and tannins. Drink from 2019.",88,19,Bordeaux

86050,US,"The lightest and most delicate of Anderson’s trio of bubblies this year, this 100% Chardonnay offers clean aromas of coconut, vanilla, lime peel and toast, and drinks fresh and lively. It’s also very dry, and finishes with a slightly bitter almond-skin note.",90,46,California
86060,US,"Someone explain this labeling: La Creole Vineyard is a blend of 96% Feltz Vineyard and 4% Madrona Vineyard? No matter the name, it smells good, boasting plenty of smoky and woodsy aromas.

Needs some time; give it a couple of years??rest before popping your first cork.",89,25,Oregon

86120,US,"The nose of this blend of 46% Roussanne, 24% Picpoul, 21% Viognier and 9% Grenache Blanc is quite lush at first, evoking pan-seared pear and pineapple, but a steely tension keeps it in check. On the palate, coconut and honey butter flavors are cut by searing acidity.",90,35,California

86180,US,"Sultry black-cherry and berry flavors and ripe deeply integrated tannins are held upright by a strident backbone of acidity in this elegantly structured Cabernet Franc. Swathes of fresh peppery greens offset sweet spice and vanilla tones on the midpalate. It's an elegant, deeply textural wine that's lovely already but should only improve through at least 2025.",93,55,New York
86190,US,"This is a quiet blend of 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc, 19% Malbec, 18% Merlot and 18% Petit Verdot. It's delicate and light in toasted oak, with clove, tobacco, blueberry and cassis flavors. It finishes on a lingering licorice note.",93,75,California

86240,US,"This 100% Merlot is soft and fleshy, with a raw meat note to the cherry, violet and smoky vanilla flavors. Feels considerably lighter than a Cab, but still important. Good with roast prime rib, which Cabernet would swamp.",91,65,California

86280,Chile,"Light and mostly fresh, with shy peach and green-fruit aromas. The palate is soft and reticent, with lower-level acids and chunky melon and papaya flavors. Finishes pithy and thus mildly bitter. Drink soon or wait for the 2008.",84,12,Limarí Valley
86290,Spain,"Light and flowery, with apple aromas. The body and palate are lean and a little stripped, but the apple flavors are clean and quaffable. This is like a waif model, or maybe a scarecrow. It is good on the surface but has very little meat on the bones.",84,11,Northern Spain

86440,US,"This tribute to the winery's wooden basket presses begins with a nose of raw dough, lemon rind and a wet gravel minerality. It's a very evenly spaced wine once sipped, walking a balance between citrus and yeast, yet not going overboard with either.",91,35,California
86450,US,"This generous wine is big and full on the nose, with two-thirds new French oak making itself felt in texture and aroma but entirely well-managed, resulting in a balanced wine.

86470,US,"A small-production wine from longtime growers, this is light and herbal, integrated in wood and tannin. It's vibrant and fresh on the palate and nose in plum and wild strawberry. High in gentle acidity, it provides a note of black tea and earthy truffle on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",93,35,California
86480,Portugal,"While the year is not one of the great Port vintages, it has produced some finely structured wines like this that will mature relatively quickly. It comes with great fruit that was teased out of the grapes in traditional open stone lagars. It is, of course, dense and full of tannins as well as fruit. It will develop well and could be drinkable soon (say by 2018) for its fruit although it will then age for many years until 2030 and beyond.",93,80,Port
86490,US,"The winery notes that this is their 16th vintage of Malbec, but just the first reserve bottling. Intense aromatics introduce a wine saturated with black fruits, coffee liqueur, soy and tobacco. It offers exceptional depth and power. Drink now through 2025.",93,42,Oregon

86560,US,"Yes, that is the official name for this tannic blend. It features tart berry fruit; a bit Zin-like; the tannins are substantial but well managed, without the chalkiness often found in southern Oregon. A good summer BBQ wine.",85,24,Oregon
86570,New Zealand,"A full-bodied, slightly heavy style with a thick texture. Smells like warm baked apples, complete with cinnamon and clove accents; tastes similar, picking up some oily-diesely nuances. Despite the heft, finishes a bit short.",84,13,Waipara

86630,Germany,"Rich summer peach and yellow cherry flavors flood the palate of this deeply concentrated Sp?tlese. It's intensely fruity and forward, yet elevated by a crush of lemon-lime acidity and a crystalline clarity that's exhilarating. The finish is long and lip smacking.",92,44,Mosel
86640,France,"Produced from 90% Merlot and 10% Malbec, this wine is made by two young brothers. It is ripe and structured, still young of course, but with delicious ripely fruity potential.

86650,US,It's hard not to like this dark-colored and superripe wine made from 60% Alicante Bouschet plus Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. The broad texture soaks the palate with blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. Soft acidity and mild tannins create a surprisingly gentle mouthfeel considering the power of the wine.,89,29,California
86660,France,"This is a svelte, easy-drinking style of Crozes. Cassis-scented fruit dominates, with perhaps just a hint of vanilla, but doesn't show much complexity. Ample weight and and an open-knit texture makes it already approachable. Drink now??022.",89,32,Rh?ne Valley

86700,US,"Stewy, chewy and quite tannic this blend splits Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache into thirds. It offers little in the way of fruit; instead it's mostly leathery earth.",82,38,California
86710,US,"A thin Cabernet distinguished mostly by its earthy, farm-like aromas and not much else. A fairly generic red wine.",81,18,California
86720,France,"This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Grèves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.",92,65,Burgundy
86730,Italy,"Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, underbrush, berry, licorice and a balsamic note take shape on this.

86760,Greece,"With its sea salt, lemon peel and fresh-fruit aromas, this wine offers focus and finesse from the beginning.

86770,US,"Warm aromas of lightly buttered apples, lemon cream croissant, yellow cake and dainty caramel invite the nose into this bottling by retired pro baseball players Dave Roberts (today manager of the L.A.

86780,US,"Overall, this elegant wine is dry with just a touch of stonefruit sweetness. Lemon yellow in color, there's brightness throughout with ripe apricots, honey and yellow freesia on the nose. A polished minerality and orange pith bitterness help keep things in balance.",86,16,New York
86790,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas.

86800,US,"Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.",86,30,California

Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors.

86910,South Africa,"The Malan family makes a ripe, balanced Chardonnay, 100% wood-fermented in French oak. The style is rich and creamy, and there are attractive hints of honey from the partial use of malolactic fermentation. The downside of that is a lack of acidity, but for those who want rich, fat Chardonnay, this is it.",88,14,Stellenbosch
86920,US,"From volcanic red soil, a deeply fruity wine. Even in this vintage they managed to wring some fine blackberry and cassis flavors from the grapes. Wrapped in rich, mellow tannins and backed by soft acidity, the wine spreads across the palate carrying waves of flavors.",88,22,California

86980,France,"Lively, appetizing aromas of ripe pear rise immediately. The palate follows in a similarly fruity, easy and juicy vein.

86990,France,Slight notes of yellow pear appear gently on the nose and become fully-fledged on the soft easy fruit-driven palate. A dollop of residual sweetness helps these fruity flavors along.

87130,France,"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor.

87780,US,"This reserve-level wine is meant to represent the best barrels of the vintage, coming from grapes grown on both the Schug Estate and Wildcat Vineyard, which makes up the majority at 80%. Austere on the nose, it offers chiseled acid as well as apricot, pear and a touch of mango. Complex and lengthy, it should become more interesting as the baby fat sheds.",90,40,California
87790,Austria,"Overtones of shortcrust pasty and fruitiness are reminiscent of apple pie on this nutty, textured and sunny Austrian original. This Neuburger's major focus is on freshness and verve. It has a pleasantly fruity, ripe but refreshing body with lip-smacking freshness. It will gain immensely from being served alongside food where its texture will come into its own.",90,21,Burgenland
87800,US,"Very dry and delicate, this outstanding-quality, Euro-style wine has a transparent pink color, good crisp acidity, relatively light body, and fresh, charming flavors like pink grapefruit and white peach. Drink it as soon and as often as possible.",90,15,California

87860,US,"This big-bottled, wax-topped wine blends half Merlot with a quarter each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.

87870,Argentina,"This opaque Malbec smells grapy, with foxy animal notes mixed in. Flush on the palate, but with abrasive tannins, this tastes like it smells: grapy blackberry with herbal notes and mild toast make up the flavor profile. A dark, blackened finish is big and spicy more than fruity and refined.",88,15,Mendoza Province

88020,US,"This is a good Pinot Noir, although it's a bit off here and there. Dry, crisp and silky, it offers pleasant cherry and cola flavors. But there's just a touch of unripeness that compromises it.",86,66,California
88030,Chile,"Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down.

88080,US,"Soft, ripe apple and nectarine notes mix with fresh lime, jasmine and Anjou pear on the nose of this unoaked bottling. A pinpoint, lemony acidity is racy once sipped, but fleshy apple and pear keep the palate grounded.",90,30,California
88090,Argentina,"Light, dilute aromas of raspberry and cranberry come with a sweet accent of red-licorice rope. This feels sticky but shallow, while the flavors are candied. A gritty, somewhat bitter tasting and tannic finish is the closing act.",83,13,Other

88170,France,"From a 2.4-acre vineyard with vines that are 60 years old, this is a tight, mineral wine, very pure and with a line of acidity and crisp apple flavors. Very perfumed, it is fresh but also densely textured, finishing with tannins and concentration as well as liveliness. Drink from 2018.",93,37,Burgundy
88180,Portugal,"This is no ordinary Vinho Verde. With its rich Alvarinho flavors, it is a wine that can be aged.

88240,Italy,"Aromas of rose, blue flower, wild berry and a hint of forest floor lead the way along with a balsamic note. The extremely ripe palate offers raspberry compote, licorice and a green note of powdered sage alongside bracing tannins that leave a gripping, drying finish. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.",89,70,Piedmont
88250,France,"This is a grassy, herbal wine with green and crisp citrus fruits. It is of course very young and its exuberant fruitiness will be better when it all calms down. The acidity and hint of apricots give the promise of a richer fuller future. Drink from 2017.",89,22,Loire Valley

88320,France,"Intense is a good description of this tightly textured and mineral-driven wine.

This is not Chacra's best PN but it's still impressive.",90,,Other
88370,US,"Shows its California origins in very ripe, lush and soft flavors of raspberries and cherries, creamy chocolate frosting and red currants. Plenty of oak adds wood spice and toast. A big, generous wine, flashy and incredibly rich, if lacking a bit in subtlety. Drink soon.",90,72,California

88440,Austria,"Gorgeously lifted notes of mint and crushed citrus foliage suggest immense purity with the very first whiff. The palate has the same lifted quality but is fleet of foot and more rounded than you would expect. It remains slender but charms with exquisitely pure lemon freshness and an essence of tart apple.

But it's extraordinarily rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, and the white pepper and baking spices make it savory. Delicious now, but it should prosper over the next eight years, at least.",95,60,California
88870,Italy,"Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate. Age this wine 10 years or more.",94,900,Tuscany
88880,US,"This starts out closed and tight, shut down by tannins and immaturity, but plenty of swirling reveals elusive black-licorice and blackberry notes, accented by smoky oak. The tannins really kick in toward the middle, but hard as they are, they exhibit great breed. Despite its sweet core of fruit, this is nowhere close to being ready. Give it 10 years.",94,50,California
88890,France,"Overtly fruity upfront, with a green apple, pineapple, papaya and spiced orange character that trails off to a simple citrus note in the mouth. The dry, short-to-medium finish is shot through with tobacco notes. Drink up.",85,20,Provence
88900,US,"Like the label says, this Gewürz is off-dry, with sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, green apples, papayas and Asian spices. It's uncomplicated and clean.",85,22,California
88910,Chile,"Earth, pepper and prickly spice comprise the aromas on this Central Valley Pinot. Feels resiny and warm, with sweet flavors of black cherry, cream and oak. Spicy, chunky and drying on the finish. Good for the price.",84,10,Curicó Valley
88920,Argentina,"Pithy green fruit aromas are short but within normal parameters for the variety. Feels a bit heavy, with a baNAa influence. Flavors of soft citrus and melon are middling, while the finish is weighty.",83,16,Other
88930,US,"This screaming deal is majority varietal, with small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. It works deliciously, thick and concentrated in cherry, cranberry and a tease of orange peel, staying crisply intriguing and amazingly light bodied on the palate. This is well worth case-stocking in one's home.",90,18,California
88940,Italy,"Aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and a whiff of dark baking spice unfold in the glass while wild cherry, black raspberry, ground pepper and star anise drive the palate. Framed in firm, fine-grained tannins, this is a classic Tuscan red. Drink through 2020.",90,29,Tuscany
88950,US,"Tangy and intensely vibrant in citrus, this site-specific white sings in grapefruit pith and zest, layering those flavors atop spicy ginger and herb. It finishes bright and fresh on the palate, eager for food.",90,25,California
88960,Chile,"Gritty aromas of red-berry and roasted fruit are not overly ripe. This feels firm, with high-toned acidic energy and a raspy afterburn. Oaky plum and currant flavors finish dry and hot. Not much cushion or softness here; requires food.",88,25,Maipo Valley
88970,US,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from a vineyard often known for subtlety packs in a ton of power and darkness, starting with hefty blackberry, tree bark and sarsaparilla on the nose. Tart black-plum-skin flavors kick off the big palate, which grabs attention but is a little clumsy at this stage of life. Patience may bring cohesion.",88,65,California
88980,US,"The aromas are light, with notes of berry, herb, dried flower and spice. The palate brings plenty of plump cherry flavors along with pleasing spice accents. It's an intriguing example of this variety.",88,23,Washington
88990,US,"Lighter in color, this blend of Conner Lee, Red Mountain Vineyard and Elephant Mountain fruit has aromas of freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, toasty barrel spices and red fruit, with the barrel notes taking the lead. It's silky-soft in feel, with generous raspberry flavors that show a pleasing sense of balance, all backed by a light squeeze of tannins.",90,40,Washington
89000,US,"This wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker.",90,60,California
89010,US,"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025.",90,50,Washington
89020,France,"Pouilly-Fumé is often the source of wines for the Sancerre producers. This wine is ripe, full in the mouth with its yellow fruits. There is a spicy character from the oak aging. The wine could age a little longer so drink from 2018.",90,30,Loire Valley
89030,Portugal,"This wood-aged wine is spicy, ripe, packed with rich yellow fruits and finished with acidity. It is beautifully balanced, the spice and toast well integrated with the fruit. Drink this still-young, tangy wine from late 2018.",90,38,Alentejano
89040,Italy,"New leather, red cherry and fresh herb aromas follow through to the firmly structured palate, along with cinnamon and white pepper notes. A young and racy wine, it already boasts finesse thanks to taut, refined tannins.",90,16,Piedmont
89050,France,"Acquired in 2006 by Alain-Dominique Perrin of Lagrézette, Clos Marguerite is situated on the top terrace above the Lot. It's a perfumed, polished wine, ripe and smooth in texture despite the attendant tannins. They give a dry core to the generous black fruits and acidity, allowing the wine to be structured as well as opulent. Drink from 2017.",92,55,Southwest France
89060,US,"The vineyard is located in the Chehalem Mountain AVA (not shown on the label) and reflects the dark, earthy characteristics of the region. Fruit is spicy, tart and tightly wound, mixing black raspberry, black cherry and a sip of Dr Pepper. That blackness continues with some licorice threading through the finish.",92,55,Oregon
89070,US,"This old-vine site, now entering its fifth decade, brings a lean, tight profile to this wine, with a strong mineral foundation. The structure and sleek styling, with tangy raspberry fruit and a slightly chalky finish, suggest that this wine will improve now through 2025 and beyond.",91,60,Oregon
89080,US,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this Bordeaux blend is dry, with smooth tannins. It has complex blackberry, currant, raisin and smoky oak flavors, and is at its best now and for the next two years.",87,30,California
89090,US,"This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.",87,35,Washington
89100,France,"Tight, crisp and mineral driven, this wine has citrus fruits and a steely texture, demonstrating that it needs to age for a year.",87,15,Bordeaux
89110,France,"This is a fresh, vibrant blend of 85% Roussanne and 15% Grenache Blanc. It's medium bodied, with straightforward pineapple flavors and a touch of almond skin. Simple but solidly made; crisp and lingering on the finish. Drink now.",87,13,Rh?ne Valley
89120,US,"Tastes a little hot, even though the official alcohol is only 14.7%, and that heated impression is compounded by blackberry flavors that veer into Porty raisins. Rich and dry, but a bit bitter in raisinskins.",87,65,California
89130,US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, grown further north than the winery's amazing Rockaway bottling, which is to say in a hotter area. Comparisons are inevitable. Although it's rich and even dramatic, it's not as impressive a wine, showing a raisiny edge to the black currants and chocolate. Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",88,75,California
89140,US,"Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured.",89,150,California
89150,Italy,This charming Chardonnay-based white (with 10% Viognier) from Tuscany offers both strength and elegance. It sees three months of oak for softness and smoothness but also has pretty floral aromas that fill in the edges. Drink it with pasta or risotto.,89,20,Tuscany
89160,Austria,"It's obvious from the alcohol that the Merlot here was very ripe. But, happily, it doesn't taste that way. The balance of rich raisin and red plum flavors are well balanced by acidity. There is some smokiness from wood, the ripeness finishing freshly with a black cherry taste.",89,26,Burgenland
89170,France,"This structured wine is firm at this early stage, with tannins and a touch of bitter-chocolate extraction that needs to diminish before the black fruits get their chance. Keep this dark, solid wine until 2022.",92,90,Burgundy
89180,Germany,"Fresh yellow peaches seem to be layered in honey and pollen throughout this lusciously sweet, lip-smacking Riesling. The midpalate bristles with acidity, but it's harmoniously balanced, bursting of fresh apples and lemons. The finish is elegant and long, laced in soft tea tannins.",92,28,Mosel
89190,Portugal,This is a good reminder that Touriga Nacional comes from originally from the D?o. The wine has power and dense tannins while also having a strongly textured character that shows up the granite soil of the region. The wine is just maturing and will be at its best from 2017.,92,25,D?o
89200,US,"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect. But the fruit is there in support—black cherries and blackberries—and the hint of toast and mocha in the finish provides exactly the right send-off into the next sip.",90,25,Washington
89210,US,"A fine example of pure, varietal, Columbia Valley Sémillon, this is like liquid honey, without the sweetness. It's more like the essence of honey flavor, coating the mix of peach, pear and fig fruits. Smooth as silk, supple and soft, it's a lovely effort.",90,30,Washington
89220,Italy,"Aromas of toast, coconut, thyme, vanilla and sugared plum cake lead the nose. The round, accessible palate offers black-cherry-marinated in spirits, licorice and a confectionary note framed in mature tannins. Ripe and evolving quickly, this is best suited for near- to mid-term enjoyment.",88,44,Tuscany
89230,US,"Aromas of spice, lees and ripe pear are followed by creamy feeling tropical fruit flavors, with pineapple in the lead. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.",88,50,Washington
89240,US,"Heady with aromas of rose petals, this wine has a thin, light-bodied texture and tastes of black licorice and black cherry. With a surprising ripeness of fruit, it ends without tension or nuance.",88,19,California
89250,France,"Made from Grand Cru vineyards in Mesnil-sur-Oger on the C?te des Blancs, this beautiful wine is maturing well. The ripe, creamy pineapple and spice character has softened the natural minerality of the texture. Full in the mouth, ripe and rounded, the wine will age more, so drink now, or better, keep until 2017.",93,70,Champagne
89260,Italy,"Spiced berry, violet, menthol and anise aromas float out of the glass. The elegant, firmly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, white pepper, clove and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins that need a few more years to unwind. Drink 2019??031.",93,66,Piedmont
89270,Portugal,"Pure Baga in all its glory, packed with dry and dark tannins and a brooding character that is mitigated by the rich dark plum and blackberry jelly flavors. It's a wine that is probably at its peak, still with its tannins and structure although now with rich fruits and intense final acidity. Drink now and until 2022.",93,80,Bairrada
89280,US,"Made in a big, ripe style, this is Gypsy Canyon's best Pinot Noir in years, but it will require some time in the cellar to soften. It's all forward, in-your-face jammy cherries now, with brusque tannins and lots of unintegrated new, smoky oak. Give it until 2013 to begin to come around.",93,95,California
89290,France,"The showpiece chateau of Berne has produced this later bottling of rosé, a wine that is ready to drink. Crisp red fruits are underlined by acidity and a bitter orange edge. The wine is lightly structured, zesty and fruity right the way through.",90,24,Provence
89300,Chile,"Earthy blackberry and black-olive aromas set up a saturated, thick palate with grating tannins. Herbal blackberry, toast and coffee flavors reflect time in barrel. It's stout and full of power and fruit on the finish. Drink through 2020.",90,19,Colchagua Valley
89310,US,"This wine's aromas are quite restrained but include whiffs of red fruit and spice. The palate is light to medium bodied, showing both subtlety and balance. A lovely wine lacking only in aromatic expression.",90,30,Washington
89320,Italy,"Well balanced and measured in terms of its aromatic intensity, this is a clean, straight-shooting Rosso di Montalcino that will pair with everything from lasagna to hamburgers. The wine shows more determination in the mouth thanks to its thick, supple texture.",87,24,Tuscany
89330,Italy,"Here's a dark and well concentrated Brunello with aromas that recall wild berries and appleskin. The fresh intensity of those aromas suggest slight volatility, but this doesn't seem to distract too much from the overall picture. In the mouth, the wine is very polished and squeaky clean.",87,45,Tuscany
89340,France,"Rounded and soft, with an attractive bite of fruit skin texture and lively fresh acidity. There is a touch of final minerality.",87,15,Alsace
89350,US,"This inexpensive Chardonnay has a fair amount of oaky depth to it, unexpectedly since only 5% of it was aged in American oak, the rest in stainless steel. Nonetheless it has toasty vanilla flavors and aromas of lime, apple and cantaloupe and tastes refreshing and clean.",87,11,California
89360,Italy,Pecorino is a very trendy indigenous Italian grape that fully deserves all the attention is has recently earned thanks to its natural structure and easy drinkability. The wine boasts aromas of honeysuckle and apricot and would pair with white meat or fish.,87,,Central Italy
89370,US,"If you like your white wines on the sugary sweet side, this one's for you. Shows classic Gewürz spiciness, with ripe tangerine, apricot, peach and honeysuckle flavors, and the acidity is just fine. The alcohol is a modest 12.5%.",87,19,California
89380,Spain,"Aromatically, this everyday wine delivers floral berry and rubbery scents. It's full and a touch gummy feeling, with creaminess and candied flavors of cassis and plum. Overall it feels good and finishes short.",86,14,Northern Spain
89390,Italy,"Terre Magre (“thin soils?? refers to the gravelly soils that characterize the Friuli Grave area of northeast Italy. This light and feminine expression of Sauvignon does deliver bright notes of lime, papaya, cut grass and wild sage.",86,17,Northeastern Italy
89400,US,"Strawberry fruit runs into light, candy cherry, carrying just a slight hint of milk chocolate. It's a pleasant wine with modest concentration.",86,36,Oregon
89410,Italy,"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016??023.",90,90,Tuscany
89420,Italy,"Earthy aromas suggest tilled soil, leather, prune, balsam and dried cherries marinated in spirits. The palate offers ripe black cherry accented with sensations of white pepper, cinnamon, fig, black tea and a hint of chocolate. It has assertive but polished tannins and nice depth, but it already seems fully developed. Drink 2015??023.",90,85,Tuscany
89430,US,"The fruit is gigantic on this rich, full-bodied and expressive young Pinot Noir. It discloses an explosion of raspberries and cherries, along with zesty acidity and a jacket of smoky oak. The wine is delicious to drink now with Pinot-friendly fare, such as grilled salmon or lamb.",90,39,California
89440,Italy,"Rocche dell'Annunziata is one of the best cru sites of the La Morra fraction. This wine is aged in large oak casks (instead of smaller oak barrique) to emphasize the natural beauty of the fruit. You'll get aromas of forest berries, dark cola and chopped mint. The mouthfeel is tonic, fresh and very long-lasting.",90,,Piedmont
89450,US,"This seems to be a bottling of some of the best blocks from the winery's Firepeak estate vineyard. Although it's modest in alcohol and quite acidic, it's richer and deeper than Baileyana's El Pico Pinot, with waves of cherries, cola, rhubarb and spice. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 3?? years.",90,50,California
89460,Austria,"The nose is still dominated by funky yeast, signaling that this Riesling requires time in bottle. The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar. Drink as of 2018.",95,63,Wachau
89470,Italy,"This opens with subtle aromas of dark berry, tobacco and exotic spice. The vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering a core of juicy black cherry accented by notes of raspberry, white pepper, vanilla, licorice and savory herb. This finessed wine is still young, but structured with tightly knit, yet fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016??025.",94,60,Tuscany
89480,US,"Well-integrated minerality and a combination of exotic fig and guava make this an inviting wine, supported by floral wafts of orange blossom.

89490,US,"A bit voluptuous in style, this bold, round Chardonnay accents fresh apple and pear with slick tones of buttered popcorn and toast. It's rich and silky in mouthfeel with a lingering kiss of warmth on the finish.",86,30,New York
89500,Chile,"Aromas of celery, arugula, snap pea, dusty apple and citrus announce a clean palate with scouring acidity. Lemon-lime and grapefruit flavors are typical of Casablanca SB, while a fresh, citrusy finish brings a green-herb element into play.",86,12,Casablanca Valley
89510,South Africa,"This leads with slightly honeyed notes of peach, melon and pear. Flavors of grilled apple skin, peach pit and beeswax unfold on the palate, finishing somewhat warm and toasty. Drink up.",86,15,Stellenbosch
89520,US,"The style can only be called “nouveau??as the soft, forward, very grapey aromas are followed by tart, lightly spicy cranberry fruit and a quick, light finish. —P.G.",84,23,Washington
89530,Spain,"A touch of brown at the edge and an plummy, woody nose open this middleweight contender. Nicely balanced, the mouthfeel is even, but the wood is overbearing on the palate and finish. The texture is right on, but the fruit fights for presence against the oak. —M.M.",84,16,Northern Spain
89540,US,"Smells rustic, with dried herb aromas, like sage and oregano although there are some pretty blueberry and black cherry flavors. There's also a tart, acidic streak that persists into the finish, and it's very dry. A Rh?ne-style blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Counoise. —S.H.",84,12,California
89550,Italy,"Made with no dosage, this is a blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Nero. Ripe apple, toasted walnut, lemon zest and bread dough flavors are backed up by crisp acidity. The refined perlage adds softness and elegance.",90,52,Northeastern Italy
89560,France,"Full and ripe, this offers balance between rich white fruits and a smooth texture that is cut with acidity. The wine is in great harmony with itself, ready to drink while also allowing the possibility of bottle aging.",90,64,Champagne

89580,France,"Ripe wine with light acidity and flavors of red currants, caramel and spice. There is a full-bodied feel to the finish.",85,,Provence
89590,France,"Very light in flavor and texture, the wine has hints of strawberry flavors with acidity and a crisp, clean character.",85,12,Provence
89600,Italy,"This soft, easy-drinking red opens with aromas of French oak, plum, vanilla and a sprinkling of clove. The juicy, straightforward palate offers black cherry, coffee and a hint of anise alongside round tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy through 2017.",87,,Tuscany
89610,Chile,"This Cabernet is not too loud, herbal or funky on the nose, but it does smell a touch rubbery, with cherry and cassis notes. A firm palate with strong acidity creates sizzle, while savory, saucy plum flavors finish with notes of brine and tomato.",87,16,Curicó Valley
89620,US,"Made in a thick, oaky style, this shows burned caramel, fudge and hints of dried mint and oregano on the nose. The palate is rich with blueberry and dark chocolate, wrapped in a veil of oak smoke, with chunky, chewy tannins and a purple-flower nuance.",87,35,California
89630,Chile,"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.",87,14,Maipo Valley
89640,US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",87,22,California
89650,Chile,"Slightly fat, figgy aromas, with notes of thyme and mint, give way to a round palate and flavors of citrus and fig. The mouthfeel has just a touch of youthful fizz, and the finish is long and nutty, with a reprise of herbs.",86,9,Rapel Valley
89660,Spain,"Briny pickled aromas are just clean enough to pass muster. This simple Viura is lemony and tangy on the palate, with saline-influenced flavors of citrus fruits and bell pepper. On a snappy finish, a briny flavor leads the way.",84,10,Northern Spain
89670,US,Traces of light cherry fruit give way quickly to a thin dilute finish. This is marginally riper than the non-reserve 2014 Pinot Noir.,84,30,Oregon
89680,Australia,"Cranberries and pie cherries give a crisp, almost citrusy, edge to this wine. The tannins are silky and there's some appealing clove-like spice as well, but the acids are elevated, making the wine come across as tart and ungenerous.",84,18,South Australia
89690,US,"From Atlas Peak sites, this is a dark, brooding wine rich in earthy loam, pomegranate, cranberry and cherry that carries a fistful of weight and power. The oaky finish could use more time to resolve. Drink now through 2020.",90,28,California

89710,US,"This is an estate-grown, co-fermented field blend of Zin with Cabernet Franc, Alicante Bouschet, Petite Sirah, Grand Noir de Calmette, Peloursin, Lenoir, Merlot and Mourvèdre made in a small amount. Powerful tannin and leather are the stars, along with flavors of cigar, black pepper, cherry and orange.",90,48,California
89720,Chile,"Harsh, fruitless aromas of green bean and ashtray come before a raw palate that's far from welcoming. Choppy, herbal plum flavors are grassy, while the finish offers nothing new or different.",82,11,Curicó Valley
89730,France,"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022??037.",97,50,Alsace
89740,US,"Fans of liveliness and structure in their wine will love this full-bodied, tight-wrapped example made with 30% whole-cluster fermentation and 20% new French oak. It has plenty of bright cherry, spice and toasted oak flavors, wrapped in a crisp and bracingly tannic texture.",89,54,California
89750,Italy,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this offers aromas of tropical fruit and white stone fruit. The round, juicy palate doles out white peach, yellow apple and a mineral note with a pleasantly bitter almond finish. Tangy acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",89,22,Lombardy
89760,Argentina,"Grapy aromas of berry fruits and the dust of spearmint gum set up a loud, high-acid, seemingly electrified palate that tastes of black currant, blackberry and plum.

89790,Italy,"The nose isn't very expressive on this big, brawny wine but the chewy, full-bodied palate offers blackberry jam, raisin, licorice, chocolate and orange peel alongside smooth tannins. It still has enough fruit richness to carry off the hearty alcohol but drink sooner rather than later.",89,20,Piedmont
89800,US,"Hendry has waited nearly four years to release this Zin, but it's not clear that age is on its side. The wine is dropping its raspberry-cherry fruit, but high, hot alcohol and hard tannins remain behind. Best now while it still has some richness.",85,30,California
89810,France,"Brilliantly fresh wine, with vivid acidity, and attractive apple skin texture and final mouth-watering crispness.",85,,Provence
89820,New Zealand,"Costco's private-label Sauvignon Blanc is priced right and offers a fruity mouthful of melon and gooseberry flavor. The citrusy finish is a bit short, but pleasant.",85,7,Marlborough
89830,France,"This wine is rich with apricot and pineapple fruits that give ripeness and a smooth, while always tangy texture. It is beautifully structured with its creamy fruits, cut with intense acidity and delicious depth of flavor. This opulent wine is ready to drink.",92,40,Loire Valley
89840,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up equal parts of this wine, with pinches of Petit Verdot and Malbec blended in. Vanilla, cocoa, coffee, herb and cherry aromas are followed by generous fruit and barrel flavors supported by tightly wound tannins. The wood is primary right now. It will be best after 2021.",92,35,Washington
89850,Spain,"Lightly smoked, minerally berry aromas are leathery and ripe, but perfectly healthy. The palate feels entirely in sync, with fine tannins and lasting acidity. Layered, earthy plum and berry flavors are spicy and show notes of vanilla and tobacco prior to a smooth finish. Drink through 2022.",92,60,Northern Spain
89860,US,"A brambly and intense vineyard-designate rich in blackberry and brown sugar, this proffers just intense enough to provoke, but never gets extreme. Soft on the palate, it has a lively undercurrent of dark cherry grenadine and black pepper. This is one to remember, with a cool label to boot.",93,40,California
89870,Italy,"Scorched soil, underbrush, pressed violet, oak, ripe berry and cured meat aromas lead the way along with a whiff of menthol. The bold, structured palate offers black raspberry jam, mature wild cherry, baking spice, toast and dried herb framed in assertive, tightly woven tannins. Give this time to unfold and develop fully. Drink 2020??030.",93,132,Tuscany
89880,US,"Exotic Asian spices and moody, brambly black fruit play at the center of this full-bodied vineyard-designate from a high-elevation site.

90440,US,"This wine is filled with aspects of black licorice, leather and high-toned red fruit, along with interesting side notes of white pepper and dried herb. Full bodied, it has zestiness on the finish thanks to a pleasant note of acidity that balances out its burlier side.",90,38,California

90510,Australia,"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.",90,16,South Australia

90650,US,"The expected cut-grass greenness shows on the nose of this wine, but so do plenty of white flowers, nectarine, golden apples and chalk.

91030,Italy,"This opens with aromas of nearly overripe black fruit and hints of nail varnish. The palate delivers blackberry, chocolate, oak and vanilla flavors, along with spirit-soaked cherries. The alcohol is very evident, and although the fruit is delicious, it's one dimensional. Imported bz Panebianco, Vinity Wine Company.",88,55,Veneto
91040,US,"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio and Pinot Meunier, this bubbly is, in a word, delicious. It's ripe with oranges, pineapples, honey and vanilla, with crisp acidity and a Champagne-like sourdough leesiness.",88,22,California
91050,France,"The vineyards of the 13th century abbey of La Ferté produces some of the best Givry. This wine has great structure with firm tannins, and also rich, juicy fruitiness that offers delicious acidity and a more solid base for aging. Drink from 2016.",88,40,Burgundy
91060,US,"Sweet and candied, with lemon, lime, pineapple, fig and vanilla flavors. Crisp coastal acidity helps provide a savory, cleansing quality.",84,11,California
91070,Argentina,"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat. Furthermore, there's rhubarby sourness at the core. Has its moments but needs more work.",84,20,Mendoza Province
91080,US,"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",87,50,California
91090,US,"A bit brittle, with big acidity and a tension of green fruit and cherries. Oak certainly helps, providing smoky vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast richness, but the stemmy flavors don't go away.",86,55,California

91110,Germany,"Whiffs of caramelized sugar and smoked nuts accent aromas of ripe, concentrated peaches and nectarines on this intensely juicy semi-sweet Riesling.

91120,Argentina,"Exotic, earthy aromas of loamy blackberry, pencil eraser, brown sugar and violet petals lead to a deep but wiry and clipped-feeling palate. The flavor profile is oaky, with spiced berry and cardamom notes leading the charge. A lasting finish is stern and doesn't waver. Drink through 2020.",91,28,Mendoza Province
91130,US,"Brimming with ripe black plum and cherry flavors, this densely concentrated wine is unabashedly fruity and forward. It's well balanced though, showcasing crisp acidity and nuanced hints of rose petal and granite. Fine-grained but penetrating tannins persist on the finish.",88,24,New York
91140,Austria,"A rather neutral but fresh nose leads onto a palate where freshness, texture and alcoholic warmth unite into a punchy, fluid and substantial body. There is real alcoholic power, countered by very fresh, luminous acidity, framed by green and red apple fruit. This definitely needs food to come into its own.",88,35,Thermenregion

91170,US,"A perfectly simple, stainless-steel fermented Lake County SB with tangy lemon and lime notes, subtle at first. The finish falls off fast.",85,12,California
91180,France,"On the austere side, this shows more tannin than fruit, based around a dry core that has spread through the wine. There is some black plum skin and black currant fruit, but it is hard to find.",85,25,Bordeaux
91190,France,"The folks at Jaboulet have nailed the texture of this wine, which is pure silk in the mouth. Mild hickory and menthol notes accent raspberry fruit, while slightly meaty, herbal and savory notes add complexity. Approachable now, it should easily evolve through 2025.",92,150,Rh?ne Valley
91200,US,"Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.",92,45,Washington
91210,Italy,"Aragosta is one of those wonderfully light and crisp Italian whites that would pair so well with the seafood dishes we love most (fried calamari and crab cakes, for example). Tonic aromas of peach, citrus and white flower emerge from the nose.",86,11,Sicily & Sardinia

91240,Spain,"This blend of Viura and Malvasia is mild, low on aromatic punch and suggestive of saline solution. This is friendly but flat in feel, with modest structure. Leesy flavors of peach and apple finish chalky and grabby.",85,16,Northern Spain
91250,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot comes across as simple and generic. None of the three components stands out, and the blend is diffuse and slightly sour.",85,38,Oregon
91260,Chile,"A bit of volatility and jamminess is acceptable here because overall the wine is good. The nose mixes graphite and cassis with leather and earth to give a sense of good things to come, while the palate is snappy and properly tannic, with nice black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors. Solid and sturdy; 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot.",86,11,Maipo Valley
91270,US,"Here's a big, tough, gritty Zinfandel that will please fans of the style. It's extremely ripe in jammy blackberries, currants, cherry pie filling, anise and pepper, and finishes sweet in fruity richness.",86,34,California
91280,New Zealand,"Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc—what more need be said? Since the bubbles aren't derived from a second fermentation, the wine tastes like a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc with bubbles. Pineapple and passion fruit notes finish clean but short.",85,15,Marlborough
91290,US,"Toast and herb mingle with lavish lilac and lavender perfume on this unique red blend (made predominantly from Cabernet Franc). Brisk berry and cherry flavors are expansive and bold on the palate, and fringed with savory herb tones on the finish.",85,12,New York
91300,Chile,"With a name like this, it should come as no surprise that this is 85% Carmenère (with 15% Malbec and Syrah). This smells like pencil lead, plastic and blueberry.

91310,France,"Dense with almost 100% Merlot, this is a rich wine. It has tannins that are cushioned by the ripe fruit and lifted by the acidity. The wine is dense with fruit, likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2022.",88,22,Bordeaux

91340,US,"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.",91,48,California
91350,Portugal,"This wine is an exemplary expression of Touriga Nacional. It has structure, perfumes, rich black-fruit flavors and a serious tannic background. Concentrated and with fine intensity, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",91,15,Lisboa
91360,US,"A pretty bouquet of violets greets the nose, followed by a bolt of black pepper. Boysenberry, black cherry and leather combine to mark the palate, which also reveals cola and anise. Soft and restrained for the variety, this is a food-friendly wine, with a gnarled bite of tannin on the finish.",91,40,California
91370,US,"Dried-fruit flavors of prune and raisin lend a very ripe, dense richness to this high-powered full-bodied wine. It has good supportive acidity and tannins to balance out the extreme ripeness.",88,15,California

91390,Italy,"This has subdued aromas suggesting oak, toast, camphor and underbrush.

You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.",88,69,Piedmont
91400,US,"McManis excels at making good wines at competitive prices and this is a prime example. It's smooth, easy-drinking Pinot Noir, with cherry-vanilla layers from start to finish. Pair with roast chicken, turkey meat loaf or simple burgers; a nice quaff at a nice price.",86,11,California

91420,Argentina,"Aromas of rubber, leather and herbal berry suggest ripeness issues, but in the mouth this is upstanding, with mild acidic cut. Flavors of leathery berry filter into an earthy, slightly muddled tasting finish with warmth and weight.",86,15,Other
91430,Spain,"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",87,30,Northern Spain
91440,France,"This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly.",87,60,Burgundy
91450,Germany,"Veins of crushed slate and spice lend complexity to this spine-tingling wine.

The finish meanders long, nuanced by hints of bramble and earth.",92,34,Mosel
91460,Portugal,"This is a rich impressively structured wine. It showcases the Alvarinho and brings out its fruit and flavors. The subtle wood aging has just enhanced the fruit. The wine is delicious and is now just ready to drink, although it will be better from early 2018.",92,18,Vinho Verde
91470,Portugal,"This is the latest in a series of special releases under the Six Grapes label. It comes from Graham's south-facing vineyards on the Douro north bank. The wine is of vintage Port quality—rich, but with some fine tannins. The jammy red fruits are lifted by acidity and by the fine perfumed character. Drink the wine now.",92,42,Port
91480,France,"Fermented in oak (50% new), this is a broad, toast-accented wine that delivers hints of honey and marmalade yet remains reasonably long and focused on the finish. Best enjoyed before the end of 2015.",91,38,Rh?ne Valley
91490,US,"Pineapple and lemon cream pie converge on this viscous, deep-yellow blend of Chardonnay and Roussanne, made by urban winemaker Matthias Pippig on Santa Barbara's Eastside. There is an emergent acidity on the palate, powered by nectarine, but it's nicely dense and rich.",91,50,California
91500,US,"From a newish, small producer that's worth keeping an eye on, this wine is earthy and slightly cloudy, balanced in nature. Wild strawberry and cranberry are pitted smoothly against firm, medium-bodied tannins and oak. The finish is crisp and juicy.",91,45,California
91510,France,"A toasty, oaky wine, with smoky aromas and flavors that mask the white fruit flavors and acidity. Hopefully all this high toast will burn off. Hold for 2?? years.",88,30,Burgundy
91520,New Zealand,"This pioneering Otago winery has turned out a medium-bodied, sturdily built Riesling loaded with notes of baked apples and spice.

91530,US,"This is a big, concentrated and lush-textured wine, bolder and thicker than many of its peers and beautifully laced with dark berry, dark chocolate and cardamom flavors.

91550,Italy,"This unfiltered, cloudy wine offers aromas of lime and yeast. A blend of Chardonnay (80%) and Viognier (20%), it's grown according to the principles of biodynamic viticulture. The juicy palate doles out white peach, vanilla and lemon, closing on a toasted hazelnut note.",90,22,Tuscany

91600,Argentina,"Dry cherry and plum aromas are earthy at first, then more briny and like olive juice. A full body borders on syrupy but is slapped by sharp acidity. Oaky, chocolaty plum and berry flavors taste slightly weedy, while toasty oak and heat make for a tough finish.",83,13,Other
91610,Argentina,"Herbal aromas of tomato, spice and red plum are a fair announcement of what's to come, namely a sharp, acidic palate with sizzling plum and raspberry flavors. Blazing acidity and little body make for a long, tart finish.",82,12,Other
91620,US,"Juicy black cherry and grippy oak are the stars of the show in this delicious red wine, softened by the addition of 16% Malbec. Elongated tannins support the leathery texture as highlights of cedar and sage play on.",92,75,California
91630,US,"Made from 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay, this dances in cherry and orange brightness within a construct of white peach. The pretty-in-pink color gives way to buzzing acidity and freshness before a medium-strength creaminess flows through on the finish.",92,26,California

91690,US,"This Pinot Noir tastes vegetal and harsh, with weirdly sweet oak flavors.",81,30,California
91700,US,"No grape seems too obscure for Kenneth Volk, not even the Portuguese varietal Verdelho. Only 92 acres are planted in all of California, including the ones Volk himself planted in Paso Robles in 1994. Aromas of red apple and pear slowly draw you in, not spilling all the goods on the nose. The flavors are relatively slight on the tongue, with nectarine, honeyed nuts and baked apple. The tight acidity makes it a great pairing for Thai and Vietnamese dishes.",89,24,California

91770,US,"This 100% varietal wine comes from a vineyard best known for its Syrah. It offers brooding aromas of mortared savory herbs, bittersweet chocolate and spice that lead to tart, well-balanced fruit flavors, backed by lightly dry tannins.",91,32,Washington
91780,US,"This wine from the heart of the appellation is woody with cedar and sage notes, its leathery texture defined by firm tannins. Full-bodied, it shows an underlying streak of bright acidity, keeping it balanced and lively in the glass, highlighted with black cherry and currant fruit.",91,75,California

91840,France,The nose is subdued while the palate shows some apple and yellow-plum fruit. This is simple and fresh but shows a bitter edge and some dilution.,80,17,Alsace
91850,US,"From the producer's own dry-farmed estate, this is a concentrated, full-bodied expression of the grape at its best, dense in chocolate and blackberry, almost syrup-like in its heady, brambly style. Burly integrated tannin create a significant foundation of weight and length, that's completely ready to be enjoyed now, yet may take on further nuance through 2023.",95,95,California
91860,US,"From the producer's Sebastopol Hills hillside vineyard, this is a perfumy, elegant wine, a combination of lavender and roses with sizable tannins and a backbone of acidity.

91890,US,"Sourced principally from the excellent Artz vineyard on Red Mountain, this blend of 78% Sauvignon Blanc and 22% Sémillon is ripe and lush, almost to the point of tasting sweet.

91900,Spain,"Forced oak and modest red-fruit aromas are good enough to draw you in. This feels snappy, with cheek-puckering acidity. Tart red-fruit flavors of plum and currant are woody but honest, while the wine's initial forced oak character settles down on the finish.",86,11,Northern Spain
91910,US,"Red cherry, clove, cola and a touch of pepper make for an intriguing nose on this rosé. The palate is a touch viscous, lacking the expected brisk acidity, but it's quite flavorful—more cherry and spice flavors with a hint of wild game.",86,26,California

91980,Austria,"Ripe apple flavors are pervaded by yeasty richness. The palate is more slender than the nose at first suggests and is made more lively by tight, spritzy acidity. Yeasty notes give an added earthiness and beautifully long finish.",89,35,Wiener Gemischter Satz

92000,US,"A blend of 60% Sémillon and 40% Sauvignon Blanc, this is barrel-fermented, with the Sémillon component being put through malolactic fermentation.

92050,France,"Berry aromas come in front of a tart pie cherry and rhubarb palate. The feel is tight and acidic, so it lacks for mouthfeel and cries out for food. As a bistro or supermarket buy it offers the most potential.",82,10,Languedoc-Roussillon
92060,France,"Rubbery and spicy in the nose, with a hint of orange peel. In the mouth, a heavy flatness sets in fast. The wine seems old, and for a rosé, it is. It just sits on your palate, tasting o.k. but needing a poke in the ribs.",82,13,Provence
92070,France,"Peppery and green in the nose, with black olive aromas and little ripe fruit. That green quality carries onto the palate, where things are thin and vegetal, with just a hint of sour raspberry to keep it afloat.",81,15,Rh?ne Valley
92080,US,"A very earthy Pinot Noir from the gorgeous Oppenlander Vineyard.

Apple, fresh apricot and green plum flavors show through the still young texture. All native grapes??5% Viosinho, 35% Rabigato and other locals from the estate—are the same used for Port blends.

92830,Italy,"The Pio Cesare starts well; a fat opulent nose of rich fruit mixed with a strong mocha character. It is also big on the palate; plummy and powerful, with good acidity. Towards the end, however, the wine runs out of steam, and it finishes somewhat abruptly and with a slight sourness.",85,39,Piedmont

93270,US,"The brand, from Terlato, has produced nonvintage wines of good varietal character, at every price level, for years. Their newest Pinot breaks the normal practice with its vintage designation. It's a decent wine, showing the silky mouthfeel, brisk acidity and cherry, raspberry and cola flavors that testify to a cool-climate origin.",84,13,California
93280,Italy,"Roasted coffee beans, espresso and rubber aromas alongside a whiff of farmyard lead the nose. The palate is bit muddled, with rustic hints of animal alongside overripe plum and black cherry that lead to sweet, almost sugary sensations. Woodsy tannins mark the bitter close.",84,25,Tuscany
93290,US,"his is a very sweet wine, but unfortunately the fruit is too thin. The sugary, honeyed flavors titillate the taste buds, but the black cherries turn watery on the finish.",84,30,California
93300,Spain,"Earthy plum and berry aromas dominate a fruit-forward bouquet. A layered, proper feeling palate delivers lightly buttered flavors of dark plum, creamy oak and spice. On the finish, this tastes a little toasty and peppery, while the feel is comported.",86,10,Northern Spain
93310,US,"An eccentric wine, very high in alcohol, yet there's a strange vegetal element. Otherwise, it's all about sweet blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce, white pepper and charred bacon. The green veggie note, which winemaker Matthias Pippig describes as “savage?? persists into the finish.",86,85,California
93320,US,"This shows an old-fashioned Spring Mountain dryness and tannic astringency, which makes it hard to enjoy at the moment. Decant it for several hours to let it mellow so you can enjoy the deep core of black currant flavor.",87,55,California
93330,US,"This tastes a little on the candied side, with flavors of pineapple and lemon tart, plus a note of sweet buttered toast from the oak.",87,24,California
93340,Greece,"This wine begins with rustic charm, and it features notes of olive, cigar box and cedar, followed by equally earthy flavors of spicebox, tomato, vanilla and pepper. The sturdy tannins and texture are softened by a wave of red fruit. Pair this with grilled lamb or burgers.",87,27,Goumenissa
93350,France,"There is a mineral texture to this wine with its blend of almost equal Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. It is tight, structured and needs to age with its crisp acidity and warmer tropical fruits. Drink from 2016.",87,15,Bordeaux
93360,France,"A pretty shallot-skin pink, this fruity, crisp wine has red cherry freshness and a bright level of acidity. With its light mineral texture, it is obviously a food rosé.",87,22,Loire Valley
93370,US,"Generous and very flavorful, this full-bodied wine resembles honey and pear in the aroma, and pear syrup in the flavor. While sweet-seeming, it has a dash of apple-like acidity to keep it lively.",87,10,California
93380,US,"This is a great way to experience big Paso power and lushness in a relatively affordable way. The wine's nose kicks off with rich and delicious blackberry pie and hot vanilla-crust aromas, enhanced by black-cherry pastry, baking spice and dill. Cassis and kirsch notes show on the palate, as does milk chocolate and caramelized fruit.",92,30,California
93390,France,"This is a structured wine that shows class and finesse. It has rich juicy blackberry flavors that are supported by some firm tannins and a dense texture. The wine is ready to drink for its fruitiness, although it will be better from 2019.",92,22,Bordeaux
93400,Italy,"Classic aromas truffle, dark-skinned berry, tilled soil and dark baking spice lift out of the glass along with a whiff of menthol. The juicy palate boasts mature Marasca cherry, cinnamon, clove, anise and chopped mint alongside tightly wound tannins and fresh acidity. A hint of tobacco signals the close. Drink 2020??026.",92,70,Piedmont
93410,Spain,"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity. It's full of spunk, grab and length, and that's probably due to the fact that it's made from Pedro Ximenez grapes and not the more common Palomino. Likely marvelous with garlic shrimp or langostinos.",90,11,Andalucia
93420,Portugal,"Very New World in its ripe, tropical fruit flavors, rounded toasty element, and impressive concentration. Yet the elegance also remains, finishing with spice and light acidity, adding shape to this rich wine.",90,22,Alentejo
93430,US,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years.",90,45,California
93440,Italy,"This Barolo has an intense fragrance of rose petal, berry, incense and spice. The palate is still a bit closed and very youthful, revealing black cherry, herbs and aggressive tannins. This needs more time to develop complexity and soften up. Drink after 2016.",90,65,Piedmont
93450,Australia,"There's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb.",90,20,South Australia

93490,US,"Superripe in cherries, red currants, persimmons and cola, this single-vineyard Pinot has a lightly silky texture, with the crisp acidity that Russian River terroir lends. It's a delicious wine to be drinking now and for a year or so.",88,42,California
93500,US,"This is the only Long Island version of this white grape variety from northeastern Italy, but perhaps there should be more. Fermented in a mix of stainless steel and used wood, there's a touch of custardy richness and some dried-spice notes, but the emphasis is on clean, crisp melon, pineapple and citrus fruit. It's medium-bodied, with an appealing focus to the lingering finish that would make it an attractive pairing to many of the region's seafoods.",88,24,New York
93510,US,"A fine Zin from some of Sonoma's best vineyards. Briary and rustic, it brims with dry, savory flavors of wild berries, cherries and spices, with a rich finish that goes on for a good 30 seconds.",88,14,California

93530,Chile,"Tight, angular aromas of cranberry, red plum, crushed mineral and dried leaves lead to a tough palate with black fruit flavors led by prune. A very concentrated, powerful wine based on Carignan and Syrah, with lemony oak and pounding tannins. Should be more tame by now; hold another year or two, and keep your fingers crossed.",87,27,Central Valley
93540,Chile,"When people talk about good value Cabs from Chile, this is what they should be referring to. The nose is balanced and offers plenty of clean berry aromas, while the palate is fresh, light in weight and mildly citrusy, with flavors of cassis, plum and raspberry. More snappy and fresh than weighty.",87,9,Maipo Valley
93550,Portugal,"Still young and showing fresh fruitiness, this wine needs time to calm down and broaden out. Made of four classic varieties in the Espor?o vineyard, it's dense, stalky and still full of tannins. Give this wine until 2016.",90,17,Alentejano
93560,Portugal,"The name of this wine refers to the blend of Portuguese grapes with French. Together they give a ripe, now mature and juicy wine. With sweet tannins and black cherry acidity, the wine is smooth, rich with a structure that's well integrated into the fruit. Drink now.",90,19,Tejo

Silky tannins and fresh acidity provide support and texture.",90,26,Northeastern Italy
93580,France,"This is a tangy, fruity wine, with orange and spice flavors. It is rich and full of citrusy acidity, with a tight structure. The wine needs a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",87,13,Provence

93610,US,"Testarossa has an incredible track record with Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and in 2007, they've produced as fine a wine as they've ever done. It's dry, crisp, silky and just wonderful in the mouth, with rewarding flavors of cherries, currants, cola, licorice, sautéed wild mushrooms, balsamic and pepper. Terrific and complex now, and should slowly age for at least sic years.",94,56,California
93620,US,"Shows the dramatic way that this mountainous region south of San Francisco can ripen Pinot Noir to such perfection. Brilliant in raspberry, cherry, sassafras, mocha, anise and cinnamon flavors, with rich notes of smoky cedar, it shows enough tannins to age it for a few years.",94,59,California
93630,US,"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and dark berries lead to full-bodied and velvety coffee, cherry and dark fruit flavors. The oak plays prominently but this wine is still pretty hard to resist.",91,35,Washington
93640,Spain,"Punchy black-cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and toasty, with stony minerality and crispness. This is a full, lively, generous Monastrell offering blackberry, spiced cake and chocolate flavors over a dark, coffee-laden finish that goes the distance. Drink through 2018.",91,17,Levante
93650,US,"A pretty pale-salmon color, this wine offers appealing aromas of orange peel, strawberry and wet stone. The palate is dry, crisp and clean with mouthwatering acids, a beautiful sense of texture and a lingering finish. It's thoroughly delicious.",90,20,Washington
93660,Chile,"Spicy plum and cherry pie aromas offer a note of vanilla before falling off. In the mouth, this is wiry and drawing, with citric acids pushing raspberry and herbal plum flavors toward rawness. The finish is snappy on the surface but hollow beyond that.",84,10,Central Valley
93670,US,"Rather grapy, thin fruit, shows little complexity other than very assertive tannins.",84,40,Washington
93680,US,"Good price for a wine this rich and balanced. It's honeyed, with orange and apricot fruit.",84,12,California
93690,US,"Barely drinkable, although you'll get by at big parties where nobody cares. It's silky, sweet and minty.",80,7,California
93700,US,"A best-of-barrels blend from the classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is delicious. It's not hard for Napa to ripen fruit to blackberry and cherry perfection, or for the winemaker to age the wine in the best oak. What's difficult is to house all this richness in such smooth tannins, with such depth and such a pure finish. A spectacularly good wine to drink now, and it should develop for at least a decade.",95,75,California
93710,France,"Dense and complex, with plum and black licorice notes upfront, followed by cherry and peat moss in the mouth. Gripping tannins and intense mineral notes are cut a bit short by warm alcohol on the finish. Nevertheless, an impressive effort. Drink now to 2010.",87,12,Languedoc-Roussillon
93720,US,"You might want to give this bottle a few years of age. Tasted in late October of 2008, it's heavy, with lots of sticky tannins. It's also a bit one-dimensional in red cherry, red currant and red licorice flavors.",87,49,California
93730,US,"Right now this Pinot is a bit heavy and full-bodied, almost like a Rh?ne-style wine with its thick mouthfeel and cherry, anise and chocolate flavors. It could easily age, throwing some sediment and becoming softer and more delicate. Try after 2012.",87,49,California
93740,US,"Broad and warm notes of light butter, baked yellow apples, cracked apricot and sliced nectarine are lifted by lime-peel tension on the fresh nose of this bottling.

93760,Austria,"The fulsome, ripe flavor of yellow Mirabelle plums beckons and is joined by peppery watercress notes and the zest of freshly grated lemon peel. Despite its slender, taut palate this has generous, joyful and appetizing fruit and an ultraclean finish. So moreish.",91,25,Kamptal
93770,Austria,"Structured and mineral, this is great Wachau Riesling. There is a core of steel that powers through, giving concentration and intensity to the perfumed fruit. On the finish there is some softness and roundness, but the wine needs time.",94,72,Wachau
93780,Austria,A terroir-driven wine from poor soil in one of the great Wachau vineyards. It's possible to taste the stone and the steely character from the green fruit. This is a wine that needs aging; don't drink before 2013.,94,67,Wachau
93790,Chile,"A run-of-the-mill Cabernet Sauvignon, it's all up front. There are nice cassis aromatics but little on the palate. The finish is short and vegetal.",83,13,Maipo Valley
93800,US,"From the folks who invented white Zinfandel, a freshly fruity, soft, slightly sweet wine with high enough acidity to keep it from palling. The color is pale pink, and the aromas recall red raspberries and peaches.",83,6,California
93810,US,"Some raspberry fruit in the aroma, but things turn rapidly earthy and herbal, suggesting dried tomato, rhubarb and oregano. The flavors are simple and uninspiring. Soft, mild, rustic and thin are other words that come to mind.",82,10,California
93820,Chile,"Fresh asparagus, green bean, lime and mineral make for a textbook coastal Chilean SB nose. The palate is fresh, crisp, clear and lean, with zesty lemon-lime, lettuce, asparagus and tangerine flavors. Long and lasting on the finish, with a spot of sweetness at the end.",87,18,Leyda Valley
93830,US,"Good price for a dry, crisp and tasty Sauvignon Blanc that will nicely wash down a wide variety of foods. It's clean and savory, with lemon, lime, pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors.",87,15,California
93840,Italy,"Made with 70% Piedirosso and 30% Aglianico, this has aromas of red currant, ground pepper, cedar and a balsamic note.

93850,Italy,"Refreshing and straightforward, this presents delicate aromas suggesting exotic fruit and a whiff of spring blossom. The bright palate offers banana, green apple, juicy citrus and a light mineral note alongside fresh acidity.",87,17,Southern Italy
93860,US,"A generous helping of spicy new oak aromas and flavors dominates the taste of this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. Beyond the baking spices, more subtle meaty flavors come out with a second sip.",87,28,California
93870,US,"Despite some big, fuzzy tannins, this Syrah is for drinking now. It just doesn't have the density for aging. But it does offer pleasant black currant, pepper, plum, tobacco and crispy bacon flavors. Give it some time in a decanter before serving.",88,40,California

93900,Italy,"Although the label doesn't say what grapes were used to make “wine for BBQ,??the deep color, structure and leafy green aromas suggest a meaty, hefty grape (it's actually a blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano). The wine has power, heft and simple fruit flavors.",86,11,Italy Other

93920,Argentina,"Dark, mossy and rich on the nose, with dried cheese, leather, baked character and heat that pretty much comes with the territory.

An impressive example of blended Malbec and Syrah.",90,16,Mendoza Province
93930,Germany,"The Kaseler Nies'chen's steep slope of blue slate faces the sunny south, accounting for this northerly site's ability to produce a dry Riesling that reached 12% alcohol in 2008. Although many Ruwer and Saar wines seem overly lean and sinewy when made in a dry style, this example verges on opulent, with exotic tropical fruit notes.",90,,Mosel
93940,US,"This 100% Cabernet has a very strong flavor. It's almost assaultive in blackberries and black currants that are sweet and jammy, while oak adds even sweeter notes of caramel and butterscotch. The result is somewhat awkward, too much of a good thing. Seems like it needs time to integrate and resolve contradictions. Try after 2013.",90,90,California

93980,Spain,Matchstick sulfur and background red-fruit aromas lead into a simple palate that's wet and lively but doesn't offer a lot to latch onto. Generic citrus and cherry Lifesaver flavors finish with a note of briny salt.,85,11,Northern Spain
93990,Italy,"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals aromas of wet, weedy underbrush, eucalyptus and a whiff of spice. The palate is extremely evolved, showing dried fruit, evidence of alcohol and a hint of anise. This has seen better days.",85,45,Tuscany

94070,US,"Half of this Bordeaux-style blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, the other half a blend of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Pretty cherry fruit and sweet oak flavors are the two main threads here, but they have yet to meld together into a seamless whole. The wine opens with plenty of black cherry flavor, then hits a wall of tannin and astringent dried wood.",86,20,Washington
94080,Spain,"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.",86,13,Northern Spain
94090,Spain,"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.",86,24,Northern Spain

94380,US,"This wine is a light red, but packaged like a rosé, and shows rich aromas of ripe black plum and red cherries, mouth-filling body and generous plummy, meaty flavors. It's very enjoyable to start an evening with and is full bodied enough to pair with big proteins.",90,24,California
94390,US,"Tightly wound on the nose at first, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 13% Malbec and 12% Petit Verdot opens slowly to show blackberry, anise and baking spice on the nose. The palate offers boysenberry, slate, oregano and bay leaf, wrapped in decent tannins and acidity. Patience will allow this wine to come into its own.",90,70,California
94400,Chile,"Silly name and label, but not a bad wine. The nose is meaty, medicinal and fails to hold its form over extended airing, but early on it's good and honest, as is the palate of herbal tomato and cassis flavors. A little bit scrappy, but for $10 it's better than most.",85,10,Central Valley

94420,Portugal,"Deep, dusty wine, tannins dominating the fruit, giving a tough feel. There are some black currant flavors, but only just a hint. This definitely needs time to soften and broaden; give it 4?? years.",88,27,Douro
94430,Italy,"Beautiful fruit intensity sets the stage and is embellished by pretty tones of honey, yellow flower and exotic fruit. This is a wonderful Vernaccia with a generous personality and a creamy feel in the mouth that imparts dense fruit and a fresh finish.",88,15,Tuscany

94450,Italy,"Rose, violet, red berry, mint, menthol and eucalyptus scents lead the nose.

It already shows breeding and class, but give it time to develop fully. Drink after 2020.",95,80,Piedmont
94460,France,"This producer, based in the Tarn valley east of Cahors, has created a rounded, ripe and fruity wine.

94540,US,"This blend of 44% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc makes a strong case for growing Bordeaux varieties in Malibu.

94550,France,"Full bodied and rich, this is a big, toasty example of white Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape. Grilled mango notes lead the way, with vanilla and toast framing tropical and stone fruit on the long, oak-lined finish.",91,92,Rh?ne Valley
94560,Italy,"You'll find aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, truffle, grilled herb and a balsamic note on this robust red.

94580,US,"An ordinary effort, with tart fruit just approaching ripeness. Sour cherries fade quickly into a thin finish.",85,25,Washington

94600,Chile,"This is flat, oily and waxy on the nose, which indicates that this 2010 offering is past its prime. Melony flavors are soft and bready, and the feel is flabby and on its way to expiring.",82,12,Curicó Valley

94710,US,"Mistral is 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged two years in 20% new French oak. A pleasing hint of funk envelops the ripe purple berry and cassis fruit. Savory herb and pepper highlights come into play, and the long, smooth finish shows clean earth and a pat of butter.",91,26,Oregon

The fruit flavors are elegant and supple in feel. A pleasing interplay between the structured tannins and acid creates a sense of tension through the lingering finish.",92,45,Washington
94750,France,"This and the other Ic?ne wine from Georges Vigouroux are massive. Despite its high alcohol, this is more restrained, derived from the high elevation of Haute-Serre. Intense black fruits and powerful tannins are well integrated and give a rich rather than out-of-control character. This would be worth aging, so wait until 2018.",92,150,Southwest France
94760,Chile,"Plum, blackberry and boysenberry aromas show nuances of citrus peel and rubber band. On the palate, this is tight, mildly tannic and slightly astringent due to firm tannins.

94940,US,"Smoky char, dried herb, cedar and cherry with plum adorn this full-figured concentrated wine, which shows a touch of heat on the palate. From a site at 1,500-feet in elevation, and blended with 5% Petite Sirah, it mellows well in the glass.",88,60,California

94980,Chile,"High-toned cherry and floral notes blend with scents of plum and raspberry. This is narrow and jammy in feel, such that it collapses a bit. The preserved-berry flavors are more generic than specific.",85,10,Colchagua Valley
94990,US,"This fine wine is made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other offerings, affording a chance to be introduced to a lovely white characteristic of the vintage and region in its friendly waves of pineapple, lemon and Gravenstein apple.

95040,France,"Generous and inviting notes of peach and yellow plum make for an exuberant, almost festive, nose. The palate is equally rich with generous stone fruit: peach, plum and mirabelle plum. A spike of lemony freshness provides a balance on the frothily fresh palate. Full marks for fruit and joy.",89,20,Alsace
95050,France,"This is a very fine wine with considerable bottle age. From its orange-pink color to its mature toast and almond flavors, this complex wine is much more than the fruit that has merged with the secondary flavors.

95060,France,"A blend of 60-40 Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this beautifully textured wine offers white fruit, citrus and crisp apple flavors.

95160,Austria,"The sonorous smoke and cinnamon-tinged tone of oak surrounds this wine. On the palate, there is a sumptuousness that marries well with the full red-cherry fruit of Zweigelt.

95180,US,"A lofty violet perfume meets bold black pepper in this lively, fresh and memorable wine, which blends smaller amounts of Syrah, Grenache and other Rh?ne varieties. Blackberry, blueberry and leather form a reel of highlights that is soft enough to enjoy now.",91,45,California
95190,France,"This is a big, rich wine, with swathes of black currant fruit and ripe spice. The tannins are there too, a wall of solid texture and dark structure. With this weight and density, it's obvious that this wine needs some serious aging, so don't drink before 2018.",91,14,Southwest France

95240,Chile,"This amounts to a flabby, basic SB from a hot vintage. The nose is dull and lacks spunk. The palate is soft and fleshy, with bitter-leaning, bland flavors of melon, mild citrus and white pepper.",83,12,Central Valley
95250,France,"Pink in color, this is a full wine that misses out on freshness. It is clean with ripe strawberry fruits, but it feels fat and heavy. Screwcap.",83,12,Bordeaux

95270,Chile,"Floral red-fruit aromas get heavier with airing. Feels thick and full, with soft tannins and mild acidity.

95380,US,"There's a distinct suggestion of citrus pith on the nose of this bottling, along with tight almond and sea salt aromas. The palate leads with a touch of ripeness, but finds a firm structure and chalky backbone, proving rather racy, albeit with hazelnut-like richness. A well polished wine.",90,50,California
95390,Chile,"Sweet on the nose, with a lot of mocha, vanilla and candied fruit. The palate is tannic and very oaky for a wine of this level. Flavors of toffee, cocoa, mocha and generic berry fruit show more oak than purity. A good wine but heavy handed with the oak. Contains 15% Syrah.",86,10,Colchagua Valley
95400,US,"A crisp wine, dry and clean, with citrus, green apple and lemongrass flavors. A small percentage of new oak adds toast, while sur lie aging brings a tart creaminess. Pretty good, but it's a little too unripe and green to earn a higher score.",86,40,California
95410,Italy,"Here's a simple, correct Ripasso (made with partially air-dried grapes) that offers clean aromas of toasted almond, red berry and exotic spice. It's thin, short but smooth in the mouth so serve this red wine on informal occasions.",86,,Veneto

95620,France,"The cave cooperative in Tavel is hitting on all cylinders, turning out numerous consistent, top-rated examples.

The wine carries its 14.5% alcohol with graceful charm.",89,48,Oregon

95810,Austria,"Rounded, earthy notes of ripe fruit are foremost in the aromatic stakes. On the palate they are joined by a yeastily textured savoriness and fresh citrus verve. This goes well beyond mere fruit and shows off the more earthy side of Grüner. Satisfyingly zesty finish.",90,20,Kremstal
95820,US,"Named for the producer's French grandfather, who loved Merlot, this 100% varietal wine from a high-elevation site is leathery, meaty and quite debonair.

95860,Argentina,"Santa Carolina of Chile is behind this Uco Valley producer, and for two years running this wine has rated the same.

96010,Spain,"One might think that a seven-year-old crianza would be fading, but this one isn't. Sure, it's ready to drink now, and cellaring is unnecessary, but the fruit is pure and exciting. The cherry and raspberry character is exact and lively, while the feel is lean and easy. On the finish, which isn't huge, you get a nice reflection of the wine amid some healthy tannins and acids. Almost certainly good with food.",89,13,Northern Spain
96020,Australia,"This Riesling is a beautiful rose-copper color. Fresh flavors of white stone fruit and straw on the palate, with more of the same, plus some custard or cream, on the nose. It's medium-bodied and is more elegant than it is zippy or fresh. Finishes clean, with hay and peach.",88,22,Western Australia
96030,South Africa,"This is a very lovely choice for an evening in with its sweet plum, pepper and blackberry flavors couched in smooth, powdery tannins.

96040,US,"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake.

96090,Spain,"Berry and plum aromas are a touch oaky, foresty and spicy. This is a tight, drawing Tempranillo with tannic bite but also fruit in reserve.

96100,Spain,"This is a dark bomber with black cherry, kirsch, lemony oak and shoe polish aromas. The palate is creamy and big, with acid-derived lift boosting blackberry and licorice flavors.

96160,US,"Very dark, very rich and nicely dry, this is a concentrated wine with gobs of fruit flavor enhanced by luscious chocolate and coffee notes. The texture is full of fine-grained tannins and the body is full. A lot of the density and texture comes from 53% Petite Sirah.",92,42,California
96170,US,"Rick Longoria is all about restraint in his winemaking, and that shows on the shy aromas of this bottling that allow hints of black plum, wildfire, roasted meat and light rosemary to emerge.

96230,Argentina,Stalky aromas of tomato leaf are light on fruit but generous on the oak. A creamy mouthfeel with soft acidity struggles to support flavors of stewed plum and brown sugar. Residual oak and related caramel flavors carry the finish.,85,20,Other

96320,France,"This finely made wine has weight and firm tannins, along with intense acidity.

96440,US,"This dry, Syrah-based Rh?ne-style blend feels like a worthy effort, but the vintage had the final say, lending a vegetal note to the wine's berry and cherry flavors. Give it time in a decanter, as airing does help bring out richer notes of cola and licorice.",84,28,California

96640,US,"A new offering from the producer, this is a barrel-aged white chiseled in a complexity of melon, dried herb and lemongrass. With subtle hints of baked pineapple and papaya, it veers tropical without becoming overripe, finishing in refreshing waves of light, bright acidity.",90,28,California
96650,US,"This wine opens in a reduced way, with plenty of barrel influence apparent. It develops in the glass into a mix of chalky tannin and red and blue fruit, with accents of black licorice and white chocolate.

96910,US,"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this has the lowest alcohol, which somehow partially helps to overcome the aggressive barrel flavors. Chunky black fruits and sweet oak combine in a muscular wine that shows none of the subtlety of the grape. It's Pinot Noir on steroids.",87,45,Oregon
96920,Portugal,"While there are some herbal, green flavors here, this wine is more about rich tropical flavors. So peach and pineapple dominate the soft texture and ripe acidity. The aftertaste brings out more minerality and a touch of pepper. Drink now.",87,16,Tejo

96950,France,"Chorey vineyards, on the plain close to Beaune, often produce good-value wines. This attractive wine is a good example from an uneven vintage. It has structure and fruit, maybe not enough, along with a fresh, tangy character. It is developing fast, so drink from 2017.",87,37,Burgundy

97000,US,"A little dull and disappointing given this winery's excellent track record with Pinot Gris, this wine may reflect the difficult, wet 2007 vintage.

A slightly metallic note creeps into the finish.",87,18,Oregon
97010,France,"A blend of Loin de l'Oeil, Mauzac and Sauvignon Blanc, this needs the shot of acidity from the Sauvignon—it gives a real lift to the ripe apricot fruits. The wine is structured, quite tight with apple skin flavors, creating an appetizing, juicy finish.",87,13,Southwest France

97120,Spain,"A rusty color is a give-away that this Garnacha isn't in the best shape. The nose smells of cotton candy and Kool-Aid. The feel is flat, grabby and tannic, while the flavors are scattershot, with brown sugar notes and dry leafiness on the finish.",82,21,Northern Spain

97910,Argentina,"Sulphuric at first, with citrus and air freshener aromas. The palate has a certain roundness and fleshy quality, while the flavors are sweet, melony and a little oily.

97920,US,"If this wine had greater acidity for crispness, it would be near perfect, but as it stands, it's too soft. Too bad, because the flavors, of blackberries, cassis, chocolate, anise, mint and smoky vanilla, are totally delicious. The flabbiness is cause for concern.",85,30,California
97930,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",85,19,Northern Spain
97940,US,"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate. Though the wine has heft, it need more strength in the midpalate and has an overall tartness that could deter. Pair it with grilled meats, though, and you'll find it shapes up.",84,15,New York

98030,US,"Very heady and earthy aromas of cedar, tobacco leaf, smoked cigar and the hint of ancho chile show on the nose this unique, cool-climate take on Merlot. The palate is quite woodsy with cedar and pine but also jammy with red fruit, bolstered by bitter dark chocolate and dried chile pepper.",91,35,California

98080,France,"Produced by Cahors negociant and vineyard owner Georges Vigouroux, this wine from vines on the slopes of the Garonne valley has just enough tannic structure to give it richness and potential aging.

98160,Italy,"Scents of black-skinned berry, violet and chopped herb unfold in the glass while the straightforward palate provides ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and a suggestion of baking spice. Polished tannins uphold the juicy flavors",88,20,Sicily & Sardinia
98170,France,"This rich, smoky wine has an appealing streak of ripe black-plum flavors. What it is missing in all this richness is enough acidity, although the tannins will certainly allow it to age. Drink this powerful, ripe Merlot from 2017.",88,25,Bordeaux

98250,France,"From vineyards on the cooler south bank of the Serein, this wine is crisp and tightly coiled despite the warmth of the 2015 vintage. It's built on a backbone of sturdy minerality, fleshed out with crisp, citrus fruit, and will be ready to drink from late 2017.",88,30,Burgundy
98260,US,Juicy approachable flavors of white grapefruit and sweet apple are juxtaposed by vibrant lemon zest and crushed mineral tones in this zippy off-dry Riesling. It's not a deeply complex wine but invigorating and fresh.,88,16,New York

Coffee flavors linger on the finish.",91,22,Washington
98300,US,"A pulsing core of dried plum and black-cherry flavors marks this buxom Petit Verdot. While bold and brawny, a balsamic edge and fine tannins lend subtlety. Its rich, mouth-filling silkiness clings pleasantly on the finish.",88,50,New York

La Romanée is a small vineyard, wholly owned by Liger-Belair, next to Romanée-Conti. The wine is rich, spicy and very complex, with black fruits welling up from its depth. With great structure, it brings together opulent Pinot Noir fruits with firm, dense tannins with immense aging potential.",96,2500,Burgundy
98390,France,"The palest of rosés, this crisp, bright and fruity wine is full of tight acidity, freshly picked raspberries and steely acidity. It could age a few more years to bring out a toastier character. The specially designed bottle has a hummingbird etched on the inside and gold on the outside.",95,300,Champagne
98400,Austria,"The enticing scent of green mango chopped with mandarin leaves sets the exotic tone. On the palate the aromatic leafiness becomes even more delicious and pronounced. White pepper, citrus leaves, and rich, ripe tropical fruit sear on the palate. This is dramatic stuff and oh so moreish. Hints of candied lime zest roar in the background. The spicy finish is very long and leaves you wanting more.",94,39,Kremstal
98410,Austria,"A creamy nose shows spikes of green freshness, reminiscent of fern or ivy.

This will blossom into further aromatic intensity with a little age. Drink as of 2016.",94,36,Kamptal

98460,US,"The winery's Affinity bottling has had mixed results over the years, but this is one of their best, right up there with the 2007.

98480,US,"One of the producer's larger-production offerings, this wine nonetheless speaks to meticulous attention in the vineyard and cellar, with velvety smoothness to the palate and savory elements of earthy mushroom. Nuanced, it ends in rose petals and black tea, with firm, crisp acidity throughout, all at an almost unheard-of price for the quality.",91,29,California
98490,France,"Ripe, soft and fruity, just hinting at the wood aging, this comes from a vineyard that was only lightly hit by hail in 2012. The acidity, spice and smokiness produce a wine that has a rich, red-fruit character that is shot through with fine acidity. Drink from 2017.",91,,Burgundy
98500,Spain,"To date, Godelia has done better with its Mencía than Godello. This wine smells like pine, wheat and match stick, all aromas related to underripe fruit. A stalky, corny flavor profile lacks ripeness, a theme that's replayed on the finish.",86,27,Northern Spain
98510,France,"Lightly stalky because it is still young, this wine otherwise promises rich black-currant fruitiness as it matures. It is balanced, ripe and with a gentle set of tannins in the background. Drink from 2018.",86,13,Bordeaux

98550,US,"The most round, smooth and full in terms of mouthfeel of all the Cayuse Syrahs, this is excellent in every way. Dark and meaty, it's tightly wound and dense with black and roasted fruits, smoke, carpaccio and cacao. The Armada Syrah offers outstanding length, depth and complexity.",97,90,Washington
98560,US,"This is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc making up the last 9%. Smooth, supple and satiny on the palate, this wine is bursting with scents and flavors of deep purple fruit, cassis, smoke and graphite. The polished, lightly textured tannins add a sense of muscle to the finish. This is a wine that may be gulped down immediately, or cellared for up to a decade.",94,52,Washington
98570,US,"An enormously  complex wine, but one that's not quite ready for prime time. Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed. With brisk acidity and slight scouriness, it wants a good eight years in the cellar, and should age well beyond that.",92,140,California
98580,Italy,"This delicious Amarone is loaded with ripe plum and black cherry flavors, layered with black pepper and clove. It's structured but elegant, with firm tannins and enough acidity to age well and develop complexity. Drink after 2016.",92,70,Veneto

98610,Argentina,"Latex and baked-bean aromas are candied at first, then grassy. This Malbec is intense but harsh in feel. Herbal plum and currant flavors are slightly horsey, and it feels hot and scratchy on a minty, herbal finish.",86,18,Mendoza Province
98620,US,"This is an unusual blend of principally Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo and Souzao, along with bits of Petit Verdot, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla and green herb lead to tart cherry flavors that seem underripe. The finish comes up short.",86,30,Washington
98630,Portugal,"As an addition to the Cape Roca range, this is impressive. It has weight and richness, accompanied with firm tannins, a solid core of dryness and blackberry fruits.",89,26,Douro
98640,Italy,"Tanca Farra is the name of the soil; the grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and the Sardinian workhorse, Cannonau (50%).

The finish is long, with cherry and plum notes.",88,16,Sicily & Sardinia
98650,US,"Schramsberg did a good job with this wine, creating a lush sparkler with generous cascading bubbles, firm Pinot fruit and a tight, spicy finish. This is still hard and even a little bitter at the end; more time in the bottle will bring out all the richness locked inside.",87,29,California
98660,France,"Attractive grapefruit and herb aromas and flavors mark the bouquet and palate of this French sparkler.

98690,US,"Made without oak, this wine is brisk with acidity, with citrus, gooseberry and white pepper flavors. A touch of ammonia makes it challenging.",82,20,California
98700,Austria,Beautifully poised notes of ripe red and black cherry are emblematic of the Zweigelt grape and are expressed here with conviction. Peppery spice shimmers everywhere on nose and palate. There is a grippy tannin structure and the spicy support of oak. This is fresh and solid and only just now hitting its stride. Impressive and totally moreish.,92,40,Nieder?sterreich
98710,France,"From vines planted as its name suggests on granite soil, the wine is structured and dense with rich juicy black fruits. Packed with perfumed fruitiness and acidity, the wine is developing well, ready to drink from late 2017.",92,22,Beaujolais

98760,France,"Wood aging has given this wine some roundness and softness without taking away from the intense grassy, grapefruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc. It has good richness as well as taut fruitiness.",87,14,Bordeaux
98770,Italy,"From vineyards ranging from 700 to 900 meters above sea level, Tasca's blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay offers fluid aromas of white flower, brimstone and stone fruit. It's an easy and refreshing wine that would pair perfectly with fried calamari.",87,,Sicily & Sardinia
98780,US,"Tastes a bit sweet and obvious now, with chocolate-covered cherry, blackberry jam, gingerbread cookie and smoke flavors. But it's pretty tannic, and well-balanced in acidity, so could develop bottle complexity down the road. Try after 2010.",87,25,California
98790,US,"Oxidative aromas of macadamia nuts, walnut oil, marzipan and dried lemon are happily cut by a soda character on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers preserved lemons, seared marshmallow and nut oils, proving fairly fat on the sip.",87,24,California

98860,Romania,"The nose on this Romanian blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Feteasca Neagra is dark and smoky with charred oak, coffee and tobacco melding into an herbaceous, woody backdrop.

98880,Italy,This luminous Gavi offers mineral notes of graphite and talc powder backed by fruity tones of peach and citrus. The wine is smooth and silky on the close and would pair with seafood or tuna salad.,86,19,Piedmont

98900,Italy,"A blend of Corvina, Rondinella and Merlot, this has aromas reminiscent of black-skinned berry, wild cherry and white pepper. The supple, vibrant palate delivers black currant, clove and a touch of pomegranate alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,23,Veneto
98910,Portugal,"This dry Moscatel has intense floral perfumes along with equally intense acidity. It is a combination that works because of the flavors of spice and lychee that give the wine richness as well. It is crisp at the end, always fragrant and ready to drink.",87,24,Douro
98920,Germany,"Pristine apple, pear and peach are marked with hints of nuts and crushed stones in this sprightly yet deeply complex auslese. It's lacy and sheer on the palate, yet lime and lemon tones are bracing. Hold till 2020 to allow the subtleties to intensify.",94,51,Mosel
98930,Germany,"While the nose is demure, the palate on this dainty auslese bursts of sweet yellow peaches and cherries. Luscious and clingy, it's irresistibly juicy, yet remarkably mineral and structured, with a nervous tension throughout. It's delicious now, yet should gain even more mineral complexity from 2020 and on.",94,98,Mosel
98940,US,"Give this wine more structure, and the score would soar. It's dry and smooth, with classic blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy. But it's so soft, it feels like it melted in the mouth. Ready now.",85,27,California
98950,Spain,"Solid and leathery on the nose, with normal berry and plum aromas. The palate is full, round and supremely tannic, with big berry, plum and herbal flavors that culminate with more hard tannins and chocolate. A rubbery wine that hits hard.",85,20,Northern Spain
98960,Argentina,"Hard, roasted and rubbery aromas suggest compost and autumn leaves. The palate is tight and layered, but tannic, with black fruit flavors, heavy spice notes and herbal leanings. Finishes with leafy notes, licorice and bitterness.",85,15,Mendoza Province
98970,South Africa,"Here's a big, rich Chenin boasting developed notes of honeydew, tropical fruit, peach preserves and soft spice. Medium-full in the mouth with good balance and a lengthy finish. The palate shows a hint of petrol along with fresh red apple slices sprinkled with cinnamon and honey. With 2,500 cases imported, drink now and, at this price, often.",88,13,Franschhoek
98980,US,"Stakes out the dry, acidic, minerally side of Pinot Grigio's personality, with citrus fruit and spice flavors and a mouthwatering quality that's exactly what you want in inexpensive bottlings of this variety. Lovely as a cocktail sipper, or with appetizers ranging from puff pastries to bruschetta.",88,14,California
98990,France,"The little touch of wood aging (three months) is just enough to round out the Chardonnay. At the same time, it does show freshness and apple flavors, with an attractive floral character. It is soft and finally ripe.",88,14,Southwest France
99000,Portugal,"This is a young, soft and fruity wine, with ripe black fruits that are lightly textured by the dry, spicy core. With some wood aging, the wine has a toasty accent and a smooth character that makes it ready to drink now.",86,,Alentejano

99030,US,"This tasty red has clean, ripe fruit notes and a pretty, chocolaty finish. The tannins are supple and the 18 months spent in mixed oak adds a touch of mocha. Little suggests that this is a specific variety rather than a pleasant, generic red wine.",87,40,Oregon
99040,France,"A spicy, perfume-shop aroma leads to a wine that is all about spice and some sweetness. Soft, round and rich, this wine could do with some aging to bring it fully into balance with the acidity. Drink from 2016.",87,20,Alsace
99050,US,"Feral aromas of blood, gristle and game provide an intriguingly sexy quality to this wine. It proves quite light on the palate, with waves of umami crashing in, from truffles and mushrooms to dry-aged beef, with hints of crushed herbs and lavender adding complexity.",92,26,California
99060,US,"Crushed sea shells, candied lemon rinds and wafts of petrol greet the nose on this wine by widely respected vintners Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton. The tight and pithy palate shows Key lime and pear flesh but leans toward tropical, with hints of pineapple and guava. It's quite stony at first, then opens toward honey on sourdough toast. Drink 2017??027.",92,56,California
99070,US,"The nose on this wine, which is now being made by former Harlan Estate cellar master Adam Henkel, is fresh and boisterous with lime sorbet and lemon glacé aromas. The palate is clean and crisp yet quite tropical, with sweetgrass, mango and papaya flavors.",92,30,California
99080,South Africa,"Everything about this elegant Chardonnay says balance and proportion. The tropical fruit shadings are carried by a solid acid backbone and accented smartly by mineral notes. A subtle yet rich perfume provides unexpected pleasure, and this wine has structure, reserve and depth. Can last two to five years.",90,15,Stellenbosch
99090,Italy,"Displaying a ripe, multifaceted nose with violets, cumin, licorice, tar and chocolate elements, this wine shows class and grace with classic dry cherry flavors.  Possessing lovely weight and balance, it is full without being heavy, and finishes with dusty rose and even tannins.",89,40,Piedmont
99100,US,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Proven?al wine, and it's delicious for the price.",89,15,California
99110,US,"Made in a méthode Champenoise style, this is crafted from estate-grown fruit, the color crimson pink, the flavors high-toned strawberry and fresh citrus. Light on its feet and dry, it features bubbles that form a rich mousse counterpointed by crisp natural acidity. On the finish is the suggestion of fennel.",92,56,California
99120,US,"OGV is the winery's estate vineyard, planted to several Pinot Noir clones. Made to age, it is light in color and elegant, depths of rhubarb and raspberry playing off each other to offer shades of savory and sweet. Earthy and mildly spicy, the wine's exotic nature and marathon finish should come hither even more forcefully with cellar time; try 2017??021.",92,68,California
99130,Italy,"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, this boasts finesse and structure. Aromas of rose and red berry carry over to the palate alongside bright cherry and yeasty notes of baked bread. Crisp acidity generates freshness, while the elegant perlage gives a silky texture. It finishes bone-dry. Oliver McCrum, Volio Vino.",92,35,Italy Other
99140,US,"With a deep golden color, this late-harvest Riesling has rich flavors of apricots and pears. It's a little on the soft side, lacking the crispness to give balance to the sweetness. Drink now.",86,25,California
99150,Argentina,"Earthy and spicy on the nose, with tomato and raisin but also some herbal green, which is likely attributable to the 50% Cabernet in this Malbec-CS blend. Tame on the palate, with tomatoey notes and dry raspberry flavors. Simple and pleasant but more herbal and less exciting that Gradum's straight '05 Malbec.",86,14,Mendoza Province
99160,Spain,"Fresh and fruity on the nose, and inviting for what it is: a basic Garnacha with color, spirit and lots of blackberry and plum flavors. The palate is tight and rubbery, but overall this is a fine value despite its short, simple finish.",86,11,Northern Spain

99190,Argentina,"Spicy tomato aromas show an herbal side as well as red plum and cranberry notes. In the mouth, this is ratcheted down and crisp, with fine acidity creating ideal Pinot framework. Flavors of briny plum and currant end more oaky and rich, with a light caramel note to go with lasting dried red-fruit flavors.",90,27,Mendoza Province
99200,US,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Malbec is a bit shy on the nose, with aromas of charred black plum, lava rock and soy sauce. Dried black-cherry and charred-oak flavors show on the sip along with thyme, oregano and marjoram. The tannins are still quite firm.",88,32,California
99210,US,"Vinified in stainless steel and not put through malolactic fermentation, this is a leesy, textural wine with plenty of minerality. Its flavors conjure up wet concrete, stone and lemon and lime peel.",88,28,Oregon
99220,Portugal,"This is a field blend from old white vines. It has a tight, tangy texture to go with its rich fruits. The concentration and intense minerality are part and parcel of the old vines and the schist soil. It has a cool feeling, crisp and tight at the end. Drink from 2018.",88,14,Douro
99230,France,"The 54-acre Landat vineyard, dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, has produced a powerful, wood-aged wine. The wood shows in the firm and dense tannic structure and gives the wine a dry perspective. Black currant and acidity provided a more juicy aspect to this concentrated wine.",88,20,Bordeaux
99240,US,"A blend of Red Willow Merlot (61%) and Angela's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers savory aromas of herbs, nori and peanut shells.

99270,Italy,"Crisp and clean with medium aromatic intensity and an easy finish, this Pinot Grigio would wash down with chicken or tuna salad. Citrus and stone fruit appear as zesty endnotes.",84,13,Northeastern Italy
99280,Greece,"This Agiorgitiko and Syrah blend is an earthy mélange of pepper, blackberry and cherry aromas and flavors of black fruit, red cherry and vanilla spice. Balanced and focused, it's a wine for sipping and pairing with food. Think pork or lamb.",84,11,Peloponnese
99290,US,"Made from a 106-year-old vineyard in Napa Valley, this wine is usually referred to as Syrah, but its exact components are difficult to define, except to call the wine Rh?ne-like. It's luxuriously soft in the mouth, with complex flavors of black raspberries, cocoa, cola, herbs, peppery spices and sandalwood. Extraordinarily rich, the wine develops bottle nuances as it warms in the glass.",93,90,California
99300,France,"Perfumed, rounded wine, packed with fruit, its ripe flavor given point with kiwi fruit acidity. There is a light spiciness that adds to the complexity. Age for 3-4 years.",92,35,Loire Valley
99310,Italy,"This 60-30-10 Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Aglianico blend from southern Italy delivers beautiful purity and intensity. Aromas here include blackberry, tobacco, leather, rum cake and polished black stone. It tastes firm and full on the palate and could use a few more years of cellar aging.",92,,Southern Italy
99320,France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017??035.",95,50,Alsace
99330,Australia,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020??030, and probably well beyond.",95,500,South Australia
99340,Australia,"This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020??030.",95,185,South Australia
99350,Portugal,"This rich wine is touched by botrytis, although its main character is ultraripe, sweet fruit. Mango, honey and an edge of toast come together easily.",87,27,Douro
99360,Spain,"Shiny pink in color, with a crisp and wet nose that powerfully suggests refreshment to come. Juicy and superfresh on the palate, with cherry and raspberry flavors and citrusy undertones. A real winner in Garnacha rosé from Navarra.",87,8,Northern Spain
99370,South Africa,"A lush and weighty Chenin Blanc with ripe fruit flavors of citrus oil, apple flesh, and green plum laced with notes of soft vanilla bean and clove. The richness of the palate lends itself to pair nicely with hearty creamy chicken or fish dishes.",87,24,Wellington

99400,Argentina,"Big, ripe, colorful and attractive, with leather and earth on the nose. The mouthfeel is a touch clanky, while the black fruit palate is broad and masculine as it shows a few holes in the fabric. With vanilla and mocha late, this is a nice Malbec with full tannins and grip.",88,30,Mendoza Province
99410,Argentina,"Baked apple, toast, spun sugar and fresh summer corn aromas are appealing and totally New World, while the palate is tropical in flavor and racy in feel. An example of acidity and ripe fruit working together to create a tasty but ripe-styled Chardonnay. Drink now.",88,17,Mendoza Province
99420,Italy,"Ripe fruit, strawberry marmalade, spice and BBQ sauce characterize this mature expression of Amarone by Domenico Fraccaroli. The wine is sweet and creamy in the mouth but that overripe note of jammy fruit appears once more in the mouth.",88,,Veneto
99430,US,"Intense and high in acidity, this wine skirts the edge of ripeness in its salty, briny take on the variety, a nod to an historic clone. Floral, it persists in apple blossom and tart Meyer lemon, finishing crisp and fresh.",88,62,California
99440,US,"Soft and smooth, this rare variety offers moderate structure and full-bodied aspects of forest floor and cardamom spice. Ripe, red fruit rules the finish, which spikes in heat.",88,42,California
99450,France,"With the potential of a good structure and fruit, this is a warm ripe wine that has concentration and dense black fruits. The acidity at the end gives it a lift. Wait until 2019 to drink this Hervé Lhuillier wine.",88,16,Bordeaux
99460,France,"Worldwide still the biggest-selling Champagne (28 million bottles a year), this well-made wine is ripe and full of fruit. Produced under the direction of chef de cave Beno?t Gouez (Wine Enthusiast Winemaker of Year in 2013), it has flavors of almonds and toast, with crisp acidity. The aftertaste brings grapefruit freshness.",89,41,Champagne
99470,France,"Named after the King of France who was crowned in Reims cathedral by Joan of Arc in 1429, this cuvée with its rounded toast and yeast flavors is attractively mature and soft. It has baked-apple flavors and a ripe, perfumed texture. The acidity at the end is gentle and rich.",89,60,Champagne
99480,France,"This is a structured wine, solid with tannins as well as ripe red berry and dark cherry fruits. The combination gives a wine that has concentration from old vines on sandy soil as well as the potential to age. Drink from 2016. The handsome ch?teau was an important fortified structure when the Lords of Beaujeu were defending themselves in the 12th century.",89,14,Beaujolais
99490,Italy,"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow flower and a hint of nut lead the nose. On the informal palate, brisk acidity brightens banana, white peach and pear.",85,16,Veneto
99500,US,"A unique blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 7% Petit Verdot and 3% Syrah, this shows soft and chocolaty, with a bitter, herbal undertone that confounds given the generosity of the full body and ripeness of fruit.",85,75,California
99510,Germany,"The high-quality oak used in this wine really stands out, providing touches of brown sugar, cinnamon, coffee and bacon to the otherwise modest black cherry fruit. It's reasonably full-bodied for a German Pinot Noir, with a long finish and supple tannins.",89,138,Baden
99520,Austria,"A complex blend that moves this wine into an international style. The wine is smooth, generous, almost opulent. It emphasizes rich red plum flavors, rounded out with jelly sweetness, the acidity coming with the a final burst of freshness. Unlike some of Heinrich's other reds, which need aging, this is ready to drink now.",89,49,Mittelburgenland
99530,US,"Young and tight, this wine is scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",89,30,Washington
99540,US,"Bella's quartet of new 2009 Zinfandels is their best ever. This small-production wine, a best-of-barrels selection from their various vineyards, is softly tannic and silky, and its flavors of wild berry, currant, cola, spice and sandalwood should be enjoyed now. The mouthfeel is utterly luxurious, offering the best elements of a Napa Valley cult Cabernet, with the briary, rustically chic qualities of Zinfandel.",94,48,California
99550,Italy,"Gorgeous and elegant, this demonstrates Tuscany's sweetest side. Trebbiano, Sangiovese and Malvasia undergo long aging to obtain impressive thickness and intensity of flavor. The lengthy finish is driven by notes of candied fruit, honey and brown sugar.",93,95,Tuscany
99560,France,"This is made in a deeper, richer style than this producer's nonvintage. It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge. On the finish, acidity and fruit come deliciously together.",93,75,Champagne
99570,Argentina,"Pure on the nose, with plenty of pop. Aromas of dark black cherry are tight and smoky, with minerality. Flavors of cola and wild-berry fruits are right on the money, and the feel is firm but deep and layered. Offers fine character and ageability. A blend of Malbec from three top vineyards; drink through 2014.",91,40,Mendoza Province
99580,US,"This dessert wine is very sweet but not incredibly so, with a flavor like apricot and tangerine jam, drizzled with honey and vanilla extract and sprinkled with cinnamon. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the acidity makes it clean and zesty. The price isn't bad, considering that this is a full bottle, not a half bottle as so many dessert wines are.",91,38,California
99590,US,"Dry, racy and clean. Shows real class, with plenty of zesty lemon and lime acidity, brightening the citrus, lemongrass, white peach and mineral flavors. Production was 3,500 cases.",91,30,California
99600,Austria,"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet",92,29,Carnuntum
99610,US,"Truly a wine that overdelivers, this packs molten fudge cake, vanilla-laced black-currant syrup and chocolate pudding with a fresh sprig of mint on the nose. The palate is soft and dynamic, with ripe black currants given complexity though licorice and butter-softened roasting herbs, all wrapped in tannins that keep the flavors steady throughout.",92,25,California
99620,Austria,"Scented and fresh, this presents wiry, full-fruited flavors of red and green apple with a good dollop of zesty, pervasive freshness. There is quite a bit of concentration on a very streamlined body with lots of drive and a very vivid, lip-smacking finish.",92,30,Kamptal
99630,US,"A gentle, easy Pinot, showing a finely dry, silky texture and ripe flavors of cherry and raspberry jam. Drink now.",86,20,California
99640,New Zealand,"Chasing Venus is made in textbook Marlborough style, with aromas and flavors of grassy herbs laid over passion fruit and gooseberries. It's medium in body, pleasantly soft and round in the mouth, just fades a bit rapidly on the finish.",86,16,Marlborough
99650,Austria,"Tight, dark tannins and meaty flavors suggest a wine that is losing fruit, gaining maturity. There is a distinct dry side while the spice and juicy acidity act as a contrast. It is now ready to drink, great with strong meat dishes.",88,,Burgenland
99660,US,"An excellent wine for drinking now. It's dry and fruity, with a meaty, fleshy texture housing flavors of blackberries, cherries, herbs and oak. Fine enough to drink with a good steak.",88,40,California
99670,US,"This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart. It needs a year or so to knit together.",89,45,California
99680,Chile,"Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",89,25,Colchagua Valley
99690,US,"A nice, pleasant sipper, lovely on its own as an aperitif, with wonderfully crisp acidity and a stony minerality balancing rich flavors of citrus fruits and wildflowers. Feels elegant and clean throughout.",89,30,California
99700,France,"This is tight, tannic and with spice and a red-fruit character. The wine is still very young with the fruit of the year masked by the tannins. Drink from 2018.",86,12,Bordeaux
99710,Portugal,"This is a light and fruity LBV. The black fruits are laced with acidity as well as the brandy spirit. It is smooth, round and with just a light sprinkling of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.",86,20,Port
99720,Italy,"This opens with aromas of espresso, leather, prune, toasted hazelnut and a whiff of dark spice. The palate is evolved, showing roasted coffee bean, raisin and licorice alongside somewhat astringent tannins. You'll also note a green sensation of powdered sage on the close.",86,62,Piedmont
99730,France,"The old vines here do give some concentration. More importantly, they give a great swathe of ripe fruit that is so crisp and refreshing. Lemon and the lightest texture are lifted by intense acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. This wine is ready to drink.",89,14,Loire Valley
99740,Argentina,"Ripe but constricted plum and raspberry aromas are firmly in the red-fruit zone. This feels good and fresh, with tomatoey acidity. Saucy plum and red-currant flavors finish nicely, with rubbery tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,29,Mendoza Province
99750,Italy,"Dark and dense, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, vanilla and exotic spice. The round, chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, roasted coffee bean, licorice and clove alongside close-grained tannins.",89,,Piedmont
99760,US,"Blended with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in a mixture of French and American oak (50% new), this wine highlights notes of raspberries and cream speckled with oak spices and an herbal edge. The palate is light and elegant in style while still retaining a sense of depth, plushness and balance.",88,25,Oregon
99770,France,"This rich, dense and complex wine has good structure, dark tannins and bright black-currant fruitiness. It's a wine with a good future, and aging will allow the tannins to soften and add further lift to the fruit. Drink from 2016.",88,28,Bordeaux
99780,US,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of wood spice, incense, black fruit and graphite. The palate brings bold blackberry flavors backed by firm tannins. It needs time to unwind. Best after 2020.",91,55,Washington
99790,Portugal,"The Aragonez (aka Tempranillo or Tinta Roriz) is complex enough to produce a single varietal wine. Here, with wood aging, it has made a richly endowed wine, full of firm black fruits as well as acidity. With its structured aftertaste, it is dense and serious. Drink now.",91,35,Alentejano
99800,Chile,"Dark jammy aromas of herbal blackberry and coffee are heady. In the mouth, this is full and fleshy. Lightly stewed blackberry, black currant and peppercorn flavors finish savory, herbal, blackened and oaky. Drink through 2021.",91,21,Lontué Valley
99810,Spain,"With each vintage this estate improves, but at the top of the Albari?o price tier it should be at least this good. There are lemon, almond and creamy aromas preceding apple, pear and melon flavors. The finish is clean, a little dusty and shows a hint of cider. Intricate enough, with fine overall balance.",89,22,Galicia
99820,France,"A powerful expression of Tannat. In the Madiran region, 2004 was a bigger vintage than in Bordeaux to the north, and this shows in the rich structure, dark tannins and spiced black fruits. It is rich enough to drink now, but the acidity, the wood and the power all point to aging over 4??0 years. Worth decanting.",89,35,Southwest France
99830,Austria,"There is a definite smoothness and richness to this Grüner, which comes from aging a proportion in wood, a definite step up in quality from past vintages. It doesn't detract from the citrus acidity, but does add an element of pear and peach, and a round, soft aftertaste.",89,18,Nieder?sterreich
99840,Argentina,"This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018.",89,28,Mendoza Province
99850,Germany,"Dusty dried herbs accent bright notes of tangerine and white flower on this bold yet elegant wine. The palate is rich, round and heavy in feel, but striking lemon-lime acidity and a crush of oyster shells adds balance.",89,76,Franken
99860,US,"Fresh, appley and floral with a touch of tangy yogurt cream, this is an approachable yet elegant Virginia pick. Delicate apple and pear flavors shine through on this full-bodied wine with fresh acidity, supple texture and balanced alcohol.",86,27,Virginia
99870,Chile,"Mossy aromas of prune and earth lead the way, followed by a juicy, almost edgy palate that houses herbal berry and toast flavors. Mildly creamy tasting on the finish, with herbs and red-fruit zest and acidity. Regular and herbal, but entirely drinkable.",86,11,Maule Valley
99880,US,"Surprisingly full bodied, fruit loaded and instantly appealing, this new Chardonnay from Hogue mixes generous flavors of apple and butter, toasted almonds and a little spice.",86,11,Washington

99900,Spain,"Heavy oak-based aromas provide cover for the grassy, green scents. It feels clunky and grabby, with jumbled flavors of sweet oak and green-leaning fruit.",82,15,Central Spain
99910,France,This is a yeasty wine that shows a bitter almond character. It has an unattractive hard edge.,82,28,Burgundy
99920,US,Classic late-harvest Riesling with opening notes of peach and stone fruit. The sweet but racy palate is home to nectarine and white flowers shot through with a streak of acidity. Not overly generous but a good reflection of the category. Great for after-dinner sipping. May improve with a few years' age but drinking well now.,84,20,Texas
99930,US,"The 2007 vintage splits down the middle in Oregon; some producers managed it well; others seemed to struggle. This Jamsheed is a pale reflection of the winery's 2006; thin with herb and leaf, stem and sour fruits.",84,25,Oregon
99940,US,"Of all Roessler's 2007 Pinots this is the only one that's overripe. It strikes you with a Porty aroma, an impression confirmed when you taste the raisiny flavors. Ready now.",84,45,California
99950,US,"This wine is rich and flashy with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, mocha, oak and spice. Firm tannins and zesty acidity add structure and brightness. It's tasty now, but should be better by 2016, as it begins to develop bottle notes.",89,85,California
99960,US,"This unusual, but successful, combination of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is a great example of modern Paso blending. Each grape variety fills in the deficiencies of the others, resulting in a harmonious whole. It has the tannic weight of Cabernet, with complex cherry, mocha, cola and spice flavors that drink well now. There's some burn in the finish that detracts.",89,38,California
99970,Austria,"An incredibly balanced wine where red cherry fruit marries with velvety tannins, medium body and clean-cut acidity and cinnamon hints in the background. This is an ideal, unobtrusive but delicious food wine that will perform no matter what.",89,34,Neusiedlersee
99980,US,"Though it's had some extra time in the bottle, the oaky edges of this wine still seem a little rough and tumble. Or maybe it's the banana cream pie flavors—appealing in their way, but opposite end of the spectrum from, say, the minerality of a Chablis. Front loaded, creamy and rich, this has generous amounts of the oak and toast that many consumers crave.",88,18,Washington
99990,Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",87,24,Mendoza Province

100010,France,"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins. At the end it is the quality of the superripe fruit from old vines that dominates, but it is certainly a wine to keep for generations.",95,37,Rh?ne Valley
100020,US,"Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth. The wine, though young and compressed, is a perfect expression of Red Mountain Cabernet. About 20% Merlot is also in the blend. 2,100 six-bottle cases made. Editors' Choice.",94,42,Washington
100030,Germany,"Makes an interesting contrast with the J.J. Prüm bottling from the same site, weighing in at a full 1.5% less in finished alcohol, and showing mineral-inflected passion fruit flavors and a touch of vanilla. The sweetness is finely balanced by mouthwatering acidity on the finish.",90,25,Mosel
100040,US,"Do you like lemon drop cocktails? This is a lemon drop wine —so ripe and round and sweetly lemony it could almost pass for Limoncello. Despite the almost 14% alcohol, there is some sweetness, as you might find in a late harvest wine, albeit concealed by the acidity. Rose petals and talcum powder flavors coalesce into a firm, full, fruity, slightly sweet and also quite fragrant finish.",90,16,Oregon
100050,US,"Racy and intensely flavored, this is high in acidity and has spectacularly concentrated flavors of apple, peach, citrus and tropical fruit. With no oak at all, the fruit stars—pure and clean. Even though the residual sugar is technically zero, the finish tastes sweet, so pair it with slightly sweet foods, especially Vietnamese, Chinese or Thai.",87,17,California
100060,France,"Ripe and full bodied, this is packed with tasty fruits. Notes of pear, apricot and white peach mingle easily together, creating a forward, wine with the right depth of flavor.",87,20,Burgundy
100070,South Africa,"There's great vibrancy on the nose of this wine, with bright scents of ripe nectarine and pineapple core, framed by a floral accent reminiscent of rose water. The mouthfeel is light and accessible, with yellow apple and lime rind flavors. Drink now.",87,12,Stellenbosch
100080,US,"The aromas of cola, java chip, licorice and cherry are pleasant and plentiful, ultimately evolving into grapey dark-fruit and cedary spice flavors. With its medium-grained tannins, modestly concentrated flavors and supporting acids, this should pair well with burgers or other casual foods.",85,19,New Mexico
100090,Spain,"Saline, mineral, match stick and tropical fruit aromas define the bouquet. It feels plump but flat, with maderized flavors of white fruits that feature bitterness and not much kick. It's fleshy, remaining slightly bitter on the finish.",85,18,Galicia

100120,Germany,"Whiffs of ripe red berries and stone fruit lend a particularly fruity tone to this just off-dry Riesling.

100130,Italy,"Made from native grape Friulano and fermented in large casks, this full-bodied, sophisticated wine opens with delicate aromas that recall lemon blossom, acacia and walnut.

Drink through 2018.",90,30,Northeastern Italy
100140,Austria,"A beautifully pure, linear but generous rendition of Riesling from the loess soils of Wagram: this has a softer aspect but still is beautifully slender and exquisitely balanced. All this needs are a few rays of sunshine to be enjoyed to the full.",90,23,Wagram
100150,US,"This white will appeal greatly to those who prefer stainless-steel treatment, with its tangle of sour apple, sharp acidity and full but not heavy texture. It gets better in the glass, softening that sharpness and tang, opening up to elements of melon and lime.",90,39,California
100160,US,"Cherry, cassis and a cordial-like richness dominate in this medium-bodied blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The fruit ripeness is elegantly offset by tobacco, leather and grippy tannin. Drink now through 2020.",90,60,California
100170,US,"From the coolest, westernmost vineyard in the appellation comes this deliciously balanced wine. It's off-dry, with residual sugar of 1%, but the considerable acidity gives a clean structure to the flavors of peaches, green apples, honey and spices.",87,22,California
100180,France,"A pale salmon colored rosé, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers scents of honeydew, red berries, peach and crushed stones and flavors to match. The only quibble is that it finishes a little abruptly. This is very good, but consumers should be on the lookout for the fresher 2007.",87,42,Provence
100190,Italy,"Here's a sophisticated expression of Malvasia with tones of toasted almond, melon and mature peach. You'll get honey and yellow rose and a nice mineral taste that gives the wine interesting dimension. Pair it with shellfish or delicate white meat.",87,,Northeastern Italy
100200,US,"Smoked strawberry and concentrated red plum aromas meet hickory smoke, fresh herb and rose petal scents in this great bottling. The zingy palate is fresh, lively and quite complex, from its oregano, thyme and tarragon notes to its core of pomegranate and dark raspberry fruit to its savory, leathery finish.",92,44,California
100210,Argentina,"Roasted, gamy aromas are slightly cool, reedy and herbal. This wine is jammy and deep on the palate, with black-fruit flavors aided by gamy notes, spice and exotic herbs. A deep finish with bold acidity solidifies the wine's excellence. Drink through 2024; contains 15% Malbec.",92,120,Mendoza Province
100220,US,"This bottling smells much like a bundle of freshly cleared sagebrush, with hints of fennel, charred tomato, wood, cola and wild black cherry. Its extremely soft mouthfeel massages the tongue with lush tannins, and its black cherry richness is cut by tart pomegranate-like acidity and lifted by cocoa, coffee and ginger spice notes.",92,56,California
100230,Italy,"Made entirely with Montepulciano, this opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil along with notes of black fruit and espresso. The linear palate delivers bright red cherry, notes of mocha and somewhat astringent tannins. Straightforward and simple, this should be enjoyed soon.",86,18,Central Italy

100250,US,"Production of the winery's most affordable red wine has zoomed up, with six different grapes—principally Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah—comprising the blend. It's a kitchen sink wine, pleasant but wholly generic in flavor, with a saline edge to the brambly red fruits.",86,14,Washington
100260,Italy,"Aromas of tilled earth, leather, violet, alpine herbs and forest floor lead the nose. The vibrant palate doles out crushed red cherry, menthol, thyme, grilled sage and black pepper alongside firm but fine tannins. Drink 2018??038.",93,50,Piedmont
100270,US,"From the Georges III Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this 100% clonal-specific wine is juicy and generously seasoned in blackberry, tobacco and black pepper. With a huge presence on the palate, it finishes with dried herb and anise. Cellar through 2023.",93,160,California
100280,US,"Herbal and chaparral-driven, this bottling from a specific estate block shows bay leaf, thyme, oregano and menthol notes against a ripe cranberry aromatic base.

100290,New Zealand,"This has come to epitomize the Hawke's Bay style of Sauvignon Blanc, typical in it's ripe fruit and oak treatment. Hints of vanilla and cedar frame passion fruit and pink grapefruit notes, then leave a lingering impression of Creamsicle behind on the silky-textured finish.",93,30,Hawke's Bay
100300,Spain,Spiced plum and cherry aromas get this live-wire Rioja going. A clawing palate with rubbery tannins needs time to settle. Toasty flavors of black fruits and oak finish with a rubbery texture due to drying tannins. Give this more time; drink from 2018??028.,91,25,Northern Spain

100330,France,"This is an attractive, ripe and fruity wine made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc vines. With soft tannins, it is juicy and crisp.

100340,Spain,"Gritty, reedy, minty aromas overshadow this Tempranillo blend's hollow berry scents. Hard, tannic and drawn in, this wine tastes of rustic plum and berry fruits along with hard spices. Notes of tomato, green herbs and raw tannins create a rugged finish.",87,19,Northern Spain
100350,France,"This Champagne is soft with ripe red fruits and a gentle acidity. It is an immediately attractive wine, with an orange-tang aftertaste. The bottling is ready to drink.",87,60,Champagne
100360,France,"A dense wine with the tannins and structure to go with the density. It is concentrated with great swathes of black plum and spice flavors, shot through with acidity.

100400,US,"The name references the clone number for this single-clone Cabernet Sauvignon. Since it is also a single-vineyard estate wine, it captures terroir in a meaningful expression. Still young, sharply defined and tannic, it is showing a lot of barrel flavors, especially clove. The Cabernet fruit is right in line with Gordon Brothers style, capturing the herbal aspects of the grape, in perfect balance, with a beautiful mix of cassis, earth and fresh, sweet herb. Very limited.",91,50,Washington
100410,US,"Made in an immediately appealing style, this Pinot is soft and lush and vast in fruit and oak richness. It floods the palate with cherry and raspberry pie filling, vanilla, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors, and the texture is silky and elegant.",91,40,California
100420,US,"Formidable acidity gives this lovely wine a freshness around complementary layers of rose petal and strawberry-pomegranate. Made from a blend of two Chardonnay clones, it adds additional notes of tangerine and lemon-lime on the lengthy, complex finish.",93,50,California
100430,France,"The slightly more evolved nose that effortlessly fuses crushed chamomile leaf and lemon zest also hints at dark fir honey. It glides seamlessly into a fast-flowing, straight channel of acidity. There is movement and poise in this virtual journey into freshness and aroma. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the palate, which is dry and of exquisite purity.",92,28,Alsace
100440,US,"In this full-bodied, well-earned Reserve-level wine, white peach, cantaloupe and lemon-lime define the ripeness of fruit on the palate, providing a fresh lushness around its substantive body and weight. A hit of decadent toffee lurks on the finish.",92,42,California

100460,US,"This Riesling has aromas that almost mimic a Chardonnay: toasty cream, vanilla, spice. On the palate, those more complex flavors continue, but are buoyed by some acidity and an intriguing touch of sweet flowers. Overall, a tasty sip.",84,13,New York
100470,Australia,The nose is honest and fresh with more herbaceous and mulchy notes than fruit. Strawberry notes infuse the rather weak palate but lead to a hit of alcohol on the finish. Drink now.,81,9,Australia Other
100480,US,"Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops.",80,28,California
100490,US,"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",97,147,California
100500,US,"Stony lemon and a twist or two of grass dot zesty acidity in this clean, crisp and focused white, sure to be a pleasurable quaffer.",88,17,California
100510,Italy,"Aromas of mature plum, French oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way.

Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",88,46,Central Italy
100520,Spain,"Aromas of green melon and pear are calm like a lake with no breeze. This feels mildly creamy, while leesy briny melon and peach flavors turn somewhat bitter prior to a soft easy finish that doesn't sing but doesn't fall off.",88,60,Galicia
100530,US,"Santa Maria Valley's terroir shines through in this Chardonnay's brisk, mouthwatering acidity and fruit purity. The bright, vibrant guava and citrus flavors are enriched with a coating of sweet, smoky oak. There's a fascinating minerality, like a lick of sandstone rocks, that boosts its complex appeal.",92,32,California
100540,France,"For the moment, the tannins are still firm and the generous red fruits have not yet penetrated the surface. The acidity is present, like a line of brightness that cuts through this richly tannic wine. This is a potentially opulent wine.",92,90,Burgundy
100550,France,"Concentrated, dense and powerful, this has all the structure of a Chambertin. As a contrast, the juicy acidity cuts through the texture, luring out black fruits that balance the solid core of tannins. It needs to age for at least seven years.",92,260,Burgundy
100560,France,"Light-footed, this wine is characterized by the clean, refreshing flavors of lemon zest and flesh. The palate is bright, with a dry, lip-smacking finish.",87,19,Alsace
100580,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, espresso, menthol and aromatic herb lead the nose. The straightforward, easy-drinking palate shows red berry, hazelnut, white pepper and a slightly green note of dried sage alongside firm acidity and not very persistent tannins.",87,20,Tuscany
100590,Portugal,"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.",85,15,Estremadura
100600,US,"This is Steve MacRostie's vineyard, located in the far northwest of the appellation, practically in Sonoma Coast. Their '04 strikes me as a little heavy and obvious now, but that may be a function of its relative youth. The wine is dry and crisp, with jammy raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. Could do interesting things in the next 3?? years.",87,40,California
100610,Spain,"Mostly Garnacha (with 12% Syrah), this Mediterranean-styled wine is locked and loaded on the nose: There's a ton of mineral, sunshine and earthy blackberry aromas. The palate is full with cherry and raspberry, and the acidity is strong enough to keep the wine stable. In the end it's almost lean and perky.",87,10,Central Spain
100620,US,"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage. The intriguing flavors center on pluot and nectarine flesh, with fringes of salinity, lemon juice, cardamom and even dashes of curry.",93,38,California
100630,Portugal,"It may be 22 years old, but this wine is still so young.

100650,US,"The vineyard is far better known for powerful, concentrated Pinot Noir, and this Chardonnay shares those characteristics. It's a big, fruity wine, not showing much finesse, but plenty of sheer magnitude. Brims with tropical fruit, apple, exotic spice and oak flavors that finish dry. Could do interesting things over the years.",90,36,California
100660,France,"89-91 Barrel sample. Owned by Cos d'Estournel, this is made in a sumptuous style for a Médoc wine. It is plump, ripe, the fruit the sole event here. It is sweet black and rich. For early drinking.",90,,Bordeaux
100670,Germany,"It's hard to choose a favorite amidst Th?rle's 2015 dry Rieslings yet this bottling is a standout for its expansive, deliciously clingy mouthfeel.

100680,France,"The wine comes from the Grand Cru village of Chouilly in the Chardonnay vineyards of the C?te des Blancs. It is crisp, mineral textured and still developing. Bright acidity and lemon-zest flavors give this wine its lively and also full-bodied character. Drink from 2018.",92,54,Champagne
100690,France,"The golden ripeness of yellow stone fruit is already apparent on the nose. On the palate a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides some structure to counter the luscious medium-sweet richness. That sweetness boosts all the fruit notes and lets them linger. It's a rounded, balanced and totally fruit-driven wine.",92,30,Alsace
100700,Portugal,"Balanced, ripe and structured, this is a fine reflection of the minerality that comes from Douro vineyards. It has firm tannins along with perfumed berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",89,20,Douro

100740,US,"Vinified in 100% new French oak, this is young, tight and showing the barrel flavors more than the fruit. As it opens, in come flavors of citrus skin, lemon drop and caramel. It's quite acidic, with good structure, and still has a yeasty finish.",89,35,Washington
100750,US,"Comprised of equal parts sweet, toasty oak, brisk acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors, this Chardonnay is successfully made in the popular style. It's creamy and rich, with a vanilla honey sweetness. Easily Ventana's best Chard ever.",88,32,California
100760,US,"A big wine, in the Ledson style, whose power comes at the cost of some elegance. Its dominant note is fruit—ripe and jammy in blackberries and chocolate—as well as sweet oak. Impressive for sheer mass, but would benefit from some restraint.",88,60,California

100790,Austria,"Ripe red cherry and smoke aromas eminate from the nose of this wine. In the palate the alcoholic heat sticks out a little, but there is a good streak of acidity and a silky texture. Good to drink now but will also keep and evolve 2018??019.",89,42,Burgenland

100900,Spain,"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel.

It's a powerful wine with a dark side that's very suitable for those fairy stories. Big tannins, black fruits and a dense structure all promise aging. Drink from 2018.",92,45,Alentejano
101010,Spain,"Buttery oak aromas cover up any white-fruit character this Mallorcan white might have in store. Resiny, corny, overly oaky flavors finish like a bowl of buttered movie popcorn.",83,15,Spanish Islands
101020,Spain,"Dusty, briny aromas are low on fruit and charm. This has a hollow, flimsy makeup to go with bitter tangerine and raspberry flavors. At this point, it's almost not worth it. It's better to wait for the 2015.",83,7,Central Spain
101030,Spain,"A blast of burnt wood and sawmill is the greeting on this heavily oaked Garnacha. Specific aromas of wood shavings, creosote and Bourbon barrel amount to a sundae's worth of oak notes. Flavors of char, coffee, chocolate and burnt wood dominate this overly oaked wine that is weak on core fruit.",83,18,Northern Spain
101040,Italy,"Elegant and creamy, with pretty highlights of peach, melon and toasted bread, this beautiful Italian sparkler makes a perfect opener for a long and sophisticated meal. Foamy effervescence gives the wine depth and persistency.",89,30,Lombardy
101050,US,"This delicious Pinot Noir is Miro's best ever. It's ripe in fruit and spices, offering wave after wave of raspberry Newton, brown sugar, Dr. Pepper cola, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that persist through a long finish. Easy to like now, but it's not an ager.",89,28,California
101060,Argentina,"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.",89,29,Mendoza Province
101070,US,"Pronounced Kay-lee, this is sourced from Red Mountain, hence the graphite and grain in the tannins. Lush cherry, tobacco and earth flavors combine, with a whiff of smoke wafting through the wine from start to finish.",91,39,Washington
101080,Italy,"Notes of hawthorne, acacia and tropical fruit open this quintessential expression of Verdicchio. The fresh, juicy palate is loaded with pineapple, creamy white peach and lemon custard flavors, accented by hints of balsamic herbs and ocean-like salinity. Energizing mineral adds to the depth.

101090,US,"This 100% varietal wine shows notes of raspberry and chocolate sprinkled with oak spices from time in 50% new French barrels. It's wound up tightly at present, packed to the brim with red fruit flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins.",91,58,Washington
101100,US,"This rich, spicy wine comes from the eastern part of the valley. It's very full-bodied, almost coarse now, but that's a function of its fresh tannins and brisk acidity.

101110,Argentina,"Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish.

101120,US,"Wonderfully rich, with a lush and luxurious mid-palate, this young wine is packed with berries and cassis, elevated with some citrusy acidity, and deep with notes of gravel and smoke. This wine is still hard and unresolved. Give it a lot of decanting, or just age for a few years.",92,42,Washington
101130,France,"Beaucastel's C?tes du Rh?ne is like a mini Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape in its blend of grapes and its sourcing, just outside that famous appellation. The 2009 is a very successful and flattering Coudoulet, with scents of garrigue and cherry followed by a palate that's round and lush without being at all heavy. Long and velvety on the finish.",91,36,Rh?ne Valley
101140,US,"Merlot is certainly one of the real strengths at Fidélitas, and two different versions are offered. This broad and flavorful effort has pretty cherry fruit backed with pleasing baking spices. The finish is focused and precise, adding streaks of cinnamon and chocolate.",91,25,Washington
101150,US,"An excellent Zin—this has an invitingly soft floral nose, mountainous black-fruit flavors and structure and plenty of depth. This should age nicely over the next 3?? years, but it is delicious to drink now, too.",91,18,California
101160,Argentina,"This purple saturated Malbec opens with powerful aromas of cola, tree bark and spiced blackberry. A saturated, extracted, highly tannic palate amounts to a heavy load, while baked and blackened berry flavors include a strong shot of chocolate. On the finish, more chocolate along with fig and baked berry flavors seal this rich ripe offering. Drink through 2022.",92,29,Mendoza Province
101170,US,"The aromas in this bottling from Brian and Stephy Terrizzi are densely packed, recalling alpine strawberry, black plum, vanilla, rose and licorice.

101180,Portugal,"At the western edge of the main Port vineyards, this estate is as well placed for fine wine as for Port.

101190,Spain,"Earthy, warm berry aromas on the nose avoid being jammy and overripe. The palate on this everyday blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo is comfortable and balanced. Short plum and berry flavors shift to slightly lactic and creamy on the finish.",87,8,Northern Spain

101210,US,"This is bottled in one of those tall, thin Alsace-type bottles, and while it's technically a dry table wine, it could almost be a dessert wine.

101220,Italy,"Beautifully packaged and presented, this Sauvignon from the Adriatic flank of Italy offers aromas of exotic fruit, citrus and dried herbs. This expression of the variety is less vibrant than others but does offer an easy, no-fuss approach overall.",85,14,Central Italy
101230,Spain,"Grassy, mildly sweaty aromas are yeasty and suggest Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A fleshy, pulpy palate is round and solid, while nectarine and melon flavors get a boost from core acidity. A full-flavored, leesy finish is slightly fleshy and plump. Drink now.",89,60,Galicia

101330,US,"Quite a good Zinfandel, although it does show some of the weaknesses that strike this vineyard in a cool year. You'll find a smooth, full-bodied wine, with ample tannins and fine berry-cherry fruit and spices. Yet it's curiously ambiguous in the mouth, and the concentration falls apart midpalate.",87,50,California
101340,US,"This ripe, rich wine can't quite get around its alcohol level, which is 15.8%. That gives it some heat, as well as a sweetness that makes the blackberries, cherries and raspberries taste like jam. Earns points for the clean, unapologetic interpretation of Paso Robles fruit.",87,37,California
101350,Italy,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot features a dark ruby color and balanced aromas of black fruit, leather, spice and rum cake. It's fresh and fruity in the mouth, with just the right measure of concentration to pair with lasagna.",87,55,Tuscany

101370,US,"The aromas are wound tightly on this bottling that eventually shows asphalt, lava rock, violet and a touch of blueberry on the nose. There's a strong dose of acidity on the front of the sip, leading into boysenberry, elderberry, pepper and herb flavors.",88,49,California
101380,Italy,"This opens with subdued aromas of dark berry, cake spice, espresso and a whiff of pressed violet. On the straightforward palate, hints of white pepper and star anise add depth to dried morello cherry while solid tannins lend support.",88,29,Piedmont

101410,Chile,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla. It just lacks that extra touch of textural richness to put it in the top category. A prebottling sample of the 2007 was more impressive.",88,26,Maipo Valley
101420,US,"A blend of Zinfandel and Syrah, this wine is softly rich and jammy, with very ripe, forward black and red currant, chocolate, licorice and black pepper flavors. Fundamentally dry, though it leaves behind the impression of glyceriney sweetness.",87,78,California
101430,Italy,"The wine's cherry and spice flavors reach a good balance and create a solid wall of taste and flavor. This is not a subtle or intricate wine, but it is a fruit-forward, juicy expression of Montepulciano with chewy tannins and good succulence.",87,15,Central Italy

101520,France,"Chapuy is a négociant based in Mesnil-sur-Oger in the Chardonnay vineyards of the C?te des Blancs. This wine, made from grapes sourced exclusively from grand cru vineyards, is all citrus, mineral and apple skin flavors.

101590,France,"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre. The wine reflects the stony character of the soil, coming through with great intensity. It is powerful, flinty, with a biting citrus character, deliciously taut and intense.",94,36,Loire Valley
101600,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",92,46,California
101610,France,"The top rosé from Sacha Lichine's Esclans estate, this is wood aged and the flavors of wood are apparent, if subtle. The wine has a great smooth texture, the fruit well integrated, showing richness as well as elegance. Not classic Provence, but certainly impressive.",92,90,Provence
101620,Australia,"d'Arenberg has a quartet of sweet wines from 2008, and this blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris and Marsanne represents a terrific value. It's syrupy sweet, redolent of honey-drizzled, spiced poached pears. To quibble, it could be a touch more complex and crisp, but it is still a succulent mouthful of dessert wine for drinking over the next few years.",92,19,South Australia
101630,US,"This old-vine wine contains 12% Carignane and 8% Petite Sirah, and is one of the larger of the producer's single-vineyard offerings.

101660,France,"This is the top wine from this estate. Wood aged and richly endowed with both fruit and firm tannins, it has a fine balance.

101750,France,"Still young, this is a wine with fruit and acidity that dominate. At the moment, it is about stalky red berry fruits that need to soften into the smoky background. The aftertaste is perfumed and fresh. Let the wine age until 2017.",88,,Loire Valley

101770,Spain,"Reduced, jammy aromas of boysenberry, plum and blueberry set up a woody, choppy feeling palate with tannins that need to mellow.

101880,US,"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer.

102160,Chile,"This tan-colored Muscat was fermented and aged in clay amphora, hence the “viejas tinajas??name. Aromatically, this is strained and smells vaguely of apricot and citrus peel. The palate is drawing due to heavy skins contact during fermentation and aging, while a short set of bitter apricot flavors is more challenging than pleasurable. Better to wait for the 2016. This is past its prime.",84,43,Itata Valley
102170,US,"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, with sizable additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Mint and bay leaf curry favor on the nose, while a severity of oak hits the palate.",84,48,California

Drink 2023??038.",93,50,Piedmont
102260,Austria,"Brooding, darkly aromatic fruit plays on the nose. The wild blueberry almost has a floral touch of peony. The palate still contains juicy fruit in a taut, firm structure, while tannins are fine but still crunchy. A bright streak of freshness brightens and guides everything, creating juicness and verve, and giving definition to that lovely, ripe fruit. This wine might take a little time to come out of its shell but is worth waiting for. Drink 2019??025.",93,25,Burgenland
102270,US,"This comes from a vineyard established in 1971—one of the first in the appellation to contribute a single-vineyard bottling of the variety.

102280,US,"A medium-sweet wine with 2.19% residual sugar, this has a sweetness like ripe white peach topped by a honeysuckle rose, but it remains light and never cloying. The nutty finish begs for blue cheese.",90,24,California
102290,US,"A very high-toned, wound-up nose slowly reveals chalky aromas, concentrated purple fruit and crushed violets on this bottling by the Daou brothers. The palate is also tight and slow to release, with hints of dark chocolate chips, espresso bean and black fruit lingering behind a walls of tannins and bright acidity. This will age well, but certainly wait a little longer to open.",90,56,California
102300,US,"The fruit for this wine comes from the Red Heaven and StoneTree vineyards, with 10% Mourvèdre and 10% Petit Sirah.

102330,US,"The expected cut-grass element shows on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic estate, but it also features riper, warmer aromas of nectarine, fragrant lemon skins and a slate minerality. There's lots of energetic pop on the sip, which shows more grass alongside lime juice, pith and skin.",88,20,California
102340,Italy,"Aromas of blackberry, toast, chopped mint and a whiff of dried rose lead the nose. The juicy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, ripe blackberry, clove and anise alongside fresh acidity and round tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close.",88,14,Piedmont
102350,France,"Perfumed green fruits, a crisp texture and layers of tight acidity all point to a wine that is too young to drink. Its hints of ripe white fruits and tangy orange peel are still developing. Drink from 2017.",88,28,Loire Valley
102360,France,This is a crisp juicy wine showing the bright red fruits of the vintage. It still has its tannins intact along with plenty of black-currant acidity and a dry aftertaste that will soften over the next few months. Drink from late 2017.,87,13,Bordeaux
102370,Spain,"Round, chunky aromas of grapefruit and passion fruit settle on friendly and varietally correct. This is snappy and solid in feel, with lime, orange and nectarine flavors. An acid-driven finish holds the line and doesn't taste bitter or green.",87,18,Northern Spain
102380,US,"A thin, sharp attack pushes subdued flavors of stem, cherry and chocolate into a quick, tight finish. In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn.",87,80,Oregon
102390,US,"Primary fruit flavors of cranberry are at the core here, with medium concentration and acidity. Flavors of leaf and stem come into play and turn the finish slightly bitter. Give this until 2015.",86,20,Oregon
102400,US,"At this price, and with wide availability, this is a great Cabernet for everyday consumption. It's dry, tannic and rich in black currants and oak, with a brisk edge of acidity to cut through oily beef and cheeses. Production was 43,200 cases.",86,16,California
102410,US,"Despite its special designation, this is a dilute wine with thin fruit flavors. The core of green apple is accented with a hint of barrel toast (17 months in French oak, 29% new). The acidity seems muted. Drink up.",86,45,Oregon
102420,Austria,"White pepper mixed with clove and cinnamon frames the cherry fruit on this elegant, almost understated red. That delicious white pepper edge highlights and spices every impression of this nuanced, moreish red.",92,30,Thermenregion

102570,Argentina,"Jammy aromas of raspberry and cherry show a slightly pickled, brambly edge, while the palate delivers tight, grabby cherry and berry flavors. There's a bit of cheesy tang to the finish, while sheering acidity and an overall light body make it food friendly.",86,17,Mendoza Province

102650,Portugal,"This is a rounded, ripe wine that exudes black fruits, soft tannins and juicy acidity. It is fresh, tight with a mineral texture.

102660,US,"This wine combines 32% Petit Verdot with 28% Merlot, 26% Malbec and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's intense in milk chocolate and blackberry-raspberry jam, high in acidity and low in oak, showing a tendency toward bitterness on the finish.",84,52,California

102720,France,"Crisp, dry, packed with juicy red berries. This still needs some bottle age, because it is still easy to taste the red wine that was used to give color. But in 6?? months, this will be a rich style of rosé, with sweet strawberry and toast flavors.",86,,Champagne

The structure is subtle but firm, the elegance borders on the Pinot-esque, thus the wine is slender but profound.",95,49,Carnuntum

102890,US,"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish.

103250,France,This single-vineyard wine has great aging potential. The minerality and tension in this wine with its apple fruit and texture is still resolving itself. Wait at least until 2019 before drinking.,91,40,Loire Valley
103260,France,"This is bright and fruity wine that has a smoky character as well as brilliant black fruits and acidity.

Drink from 2018.",91,30,Burgundy

103340,US,"Soft, sweet and gluey. A hard wine to like despite rich raspberry and mocha flavors.",81,22,California
103350,US,"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California.

103380,US,"Occasio continues to build its case for being a winery to watch out of the Livermore Valley, releasing this lively, raspberry and honeycomb rosé made from Pinot Noir grapes out of its Del Arroyo Vineyard. The Pommard clone fruit was cold soaked in stainless steel, then pressed from the skins and racked again into stainless steel. A rosé with some meat on its bones, it's way more than an aperitif and will stand strongly aside a full range of summer foods.",88,22,California
103390,France,"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity. The fruit goes right to the green apples, kiwi and juicy lemon flavors, but the structure is bold and rounds out these crisp fruits. A wine for aging, perhaps 2?? years.",90,35,Burgundy
103400,US,"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott.

103450,Spain,"Stewy, earthy and muddled on the nose, this gran reserva from a notoriously cold and wet vintage comes across as forced, as if long hangtime was sought to offset poor weather conditions. Stewy flavors of plum and spicecake finish flat and heavy, with tannic thud.",88,28,Northern Spain
103460,Italy,"Heady aromas of mango and yellow peach follow through to the zesty, full-bodied palate along with a mineral note. Bracing acidity brightens the flavors and leaves a tangy finish.",88,,Northeastern Italy

103590,US,"Whiffs of tea leaves and tobacco lend earthiness to this slightly savory but exotic appealing rosé. There's plenty of red-cherry and raspberry flavor, but it's slightly muted, embraced in shrouds of Cabernet Franc's brambly leafy character.

103600,US,"This wine from the Fess Parker-owned Rodney's Vineyard shows inky purple color, offering slightly reductive aromas of tar and charred meat but also violets and black pepper. It's full on the palate, hitting first with purple fruit and dried purple flowers before delivering plum-skin acidity and peppery spice. It's an attention-grabber.",91,28,California

103650,US,"A great success, especially given the difficulties of the vintage. With a modest alcohol reading of 13.8% by volume, it's exuberantly ripe in cherries and umami-filled red currants, with oak adding just the right notes of toast.

104890,US,"Reddish-orange in color, this is a high-toned, citrus-laden wine that retains fresh flavors of grapefruit and mandarin orange.

104900,France,"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out.

104960,France,"From Ch?teau des Landes' old vines, this is a concentrated, solid wine. Dark tannins have dark chocolate and licorice flavors, with a structure that dominates the fruit and needs to soften. New wood aging was perhaps excessive, but give the wine time. Drink from 2017.",88,40,Bordeaux

105420,US,"Made in a completely different style from Uvaggio's typical Primitivo, this is meant to be a reserve-tier bottling, with seven months in new and once-used oak.

105510,US,"Front-loaded with cherries, violets, red currants and mocha, this Merlot isn't just about flavor. It also has depth and length, in other words a complexity that lifts it above the average. It's already throwing some sediment, suggesting that even a year or two in the bottle will help it mellow.",88,42,California
105520,Argentina,"Rooty aromas are ripe on one hand and lighty herbal on the other. This feels focused and crisp, with good structure and tannins in front of raspberry and cassis flavors. For the most part this is on the money, even with a finish that's flat in feel and earthy in flavor. The blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Malbec.",88,12,Other
105530,Austria,"A touch of ripe yellow apple plays on the nose and carries appetizingly onto the palate.

105550,France,"Friendly, fresh ripe apples beckon on the nose. The pure and fruit-driven palate follows suit, presenting flavors of juicy, ripe apples. A smidgen of residual sugar boosts these delicious fruit flavors and turns up the volume on ease and joy but Riesling's vibrant freshness counters this masterfully so the finish is just off dry. This is lovely, bouncy and full of joy. Drink 2017??022.",92,,Alsace

105570,France,"91??3. Barrel sample. There is a fine depth of flavor here, with solid tannins as well as ripe fruit. This second wine of Ch?teau Pichon Longueville is packed with the vintage's hallmark of perfumed black-currant fruit.",92,,Bordeaux
105580,France,"Big and dry, this wine shows the tannic, firm character of the vintage. It has a dark, dense core of wood tannins while the juicy black currant fruit is still developing. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.",88,,Bordeaux
105590,Argentina,"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well.",88,19,Mendoza Province

105620,Bulgaria,"Rich aromas of boysenberry, cranberry, pipe tobacco and dark chocolate prepare the palate for flavors of cherry syrup and pomegranate. Soft but persistent tannins are apparent in the mouth, and the finish offers lingering flavors of dark chocolate and coffee.",90,11,Thracian Valley
105630,US,"This sports some chewy, herbaceous qualities that hit you right away. That intensity puts the focus on the wine's edges rather than its core fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. Tight and stiff, it's got a puckery bite that suggests further bottle age may be a good idea.",89,52,Oregon
105640,Italy,"This is a gorgeous wine with loads of intensity and personality derived from the native Corvina grape of Valpolicella, Italy. It's amazingly rich and smooth with long-lasting flavors of maraschino cherry, Indian spice and cola.",93,90,Veneto

Drink 2014 and beyond.",92,110,California
105670,US,"At this price, buy a bunch and pour it in paper cups at your next big party. You won't get any complaints. Blackberry, chocolate and oak-like flavors are front and center.",83,8,California

105690,Italy,"Aromas suggesting ripe plum, exotic spice, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco take shape in the glass.

Drink 2018??026.",93,150,Tuscany
105700,Italy,"Red berry, pressed violet, tilled earth and new leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this.

105710,France,"This comes from an underrated appellation, in the shadow of the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard. It's touched lightly by wood aging, showing ripe yellow fruit and a cool streak of minerality. Still young, it's developing well and will be ready to drink from 2018.",92,38,Burgundy
105720,France,"89-91 Barrel sample. Rich and sweet, with fresh tannins and solid fruit flavors. The wine is dark, but has vivid acidity.",90,,Bordeaux

105740,France,"88-90 Barrel sample. Sweet vanilla aroma, fruit that is ripe, soft, fleshy. This seems to have suffered from super-mature, fruit, although a final juiciness does help.",89,,Bordeaux

105760,Italy,"This offers vibrant aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather, spice and cigar box. There are dark touches of resin and brown sugar that are followed by notes of smoked bacon and cured meat. This is dark, masculine and concentrated.",89,45,Veneto
105770,Chile,"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky.",87,16,Maipo Valley
105780,US,"The flavors of this Cabernet are enormously rich. Blackberry and blueberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cassis come in waves. Few wines on earth are this ripe. The issue is balance and complexity, both of which could be stronger. Drink over the next few years.",87,40,California
105790,US,"This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses.",87,27,California
105800,Chile,"Super light in color, with aromas of grape skins, nectarine and briny seashell, this rosé from Carmenère feels highly citric and shearing. Sour-leaning flavors of tangerine and lemon finish with tang and enamel-peeling acidity.",84,13,Maule Valley
105810,Chile,"Heavy aromas of oak, char and syrupy berry fruits don't smell entirely natural. This feels tannic and scratchy, with missing parts. The flavor of candied, sweet, dominating oak is front and center, while mint, carob and stewed berry flavors finish this off.",84,16,Colchagua Valley
105820,France,"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",84,15,Bordeaux
105830,South Africa,Approachable now with an enticing mocha streak throughout that's lifted by the bright red cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Low tannins and medium acidity make this an easy-pleaser for fans of the grape.,87,20,Elgin

105850,Italy,"One of the best qualities of Gavi is that tight, mineral note of talc powder or crushed stone that holds it all together. La Meirana is exemplary in this regard making this crisp wine perfect for fresh spring asparagus or a local Piedmont speciality such as sformati, a blended vegetable flan.",87,24,Piedmont
105860,US,"A shade less opulent but finer and more structured than the '04. The tannins are as fine as in any Napa cult Cab, yet the flavors are exotic, with tiers of black currants, red cherries, licorice, dark chocolate, violets, pepper, leather and Chinese mu shu plum sauce. Drink now with substantial roasts; should age for a decade.",93,38,California
105870,Chile,"A little rubbery and tough on first sniff, but this pedigreed Chilean Cab settles with airing and soon shows exciting, fully ripe raspberry, cassis and blackberry flavors. The mouthfeel is perfectly cushioned yet intense, and the finish is ripe, smooth and composed. Ready to go now but should hold steady for another three years.",92,37,Pirque
105880,US,"This is a half-bottle of Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Arroyo Seco, one of the best sources in California for crisp white wines. With residual sugar of 18.4%, it's very sweet, but it's not a sugar bomb.

105890,US,"A “kitchen sink??blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot, the Wild Z shows far more flavors of vanilla and black tea than fruit. A popular style to be sure, fine for everyday drinking.",86,20,Washington

105910,Austria,"This is a light wine, with a white fruit flavor and a taut, mineral character. It is all fruit with layer upon layer of pear and crisp acidity. Drink over the year as it's not meant for aging. Screwcap.",86,11,Nieder?sterreich

105940,Greece,"This Muscat offers luscious honey, lemon and tropical fruit on the nose, with viscous waves of lemon, pineapple and warming spice on the palate. Not overly complex but certainly appealing. Pair with creamy cheeses and fruit.",87,30,Muscat of Kefallonian
105950,US,"A big Pinot Noir, extracted and thick in cherry and blueberry pie filling, red currant, sandalwood and dusty spice flavors. Delicious, but soft and atypical for a Pinot, lacking some life and charm. Drink now.",87,43,California

106000,US,"A bit heavy now, with lots of unintegrated parts. The new oak sticks out from the tannins, and the blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit is all primary and jammy. If you drink now, decant, but this 100% Cab should be better after 2010.",87,36,California
106010,US,"A classic, boldly full-bodied offering of the variety from vineyards in Sonoma Valley, Knights Valley and Alexander Valley, this wine is defined by blackberry, cassis and mocha, its mouthfeel velvety and luxurious. The finish is lengthy and accented in sage.",90,35,California

106040,France,"Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins.

106050,US,"Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is at the heart of this bright, quaffable and value-priced wine. There's a light dusting of pepper also, but it's the fresh fruit that stands out.",87,17,Oregon
106060,US,"A rainy cement minerality on the nose of this sweet wine manages to cut through the sugared oranges, honeysuckle and ripe, tropical white fleshed fruit, from peach to cherimoya. The palate is full of honeyed apples, white peach and pineapple, but the decent acidity and chalky element stops it short of treacly.",87,10,California
106070,US,"Sugary sweet and simple, like an apricot, orange and mango fruit juice drink. The alcohol lends body and warmth.",85,16,California

106130,France,"Dried thyme and bay leaves impart a welcome herbal element to this wine's dark fruit. Hints of espresso, roasted meat and black olive help flesh out this slightly firm, linear blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. With its crisp, dusty finish and admirable concentration, it look capable of aging through 2020.",90,,Rh?ne Valley
106140,US,"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a floral and fruity wine from a great Carneros vineyard. Offering sharp acidity and rounded flavors of honey and apple, it begs to be enjoyed with food along the lines of foie gras and fresh oysters.",90,32,California

106190,US,"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak.

106320,France,"This wine has a firm structure as well as plenty of fruit. The wine's acidity, crisp red-currant fruit and bright character are balanced by the firm, smoky and dry tannins. Give this structure time to soften and fill out into a ripe wine. Drink from 2019.",88,16,Beaujolais

106380,US,"This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights.

106800,Italy,"This pink sweet sparkling wine opens with sweet notes of raspberry, vanilla cream, cinnamon and a touch of white pepper. The smooth mouthfeel is supported by fizzy effervescence.

106860,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy.

108770,Spain,"This salmon-colored wine made from Tempranillo is neutral in aromas, with a touch of creaminess on an otherwise standard palate. Mild peach flavors are slightly bitter. The wine loses freshness and focus the longer it sits.",85,11,Northern Spain
108780,France,"Fresh and fragrant, this is a lively, bright and tangy wine. With crisp acidity and raspberry fruit that is twisted with orange peel it is ready to drink.",85,11,Bordeaux
108790,US,"You won't miss the presence of oak in this Chardonnay. It's brilliantly forward, ripe and savory, with orange, mango and lime flavors. Natural acidity and a creamy, leesy richness bring extra layers of appeal, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",92,27,California
108800,Italy,"Elegant, toned and aromatically intense, this shows fine aromas of wild berry, crushed mineral, dried tobacco, cola and a touch of mint. The palate has a fresh, light and feminine touch that's backed by firm tannin.",92,65,Piedmont
108810,US,"This shows a fine balance of citrus and tropical fruit richness with a firm minerality, and the oak is pleasantly in the background. A touch of lees character gives it a Champagne-like doughiness.",92,28,California
108820,Italy,"This opens with aromas that suggest orchard fruit and citrus. The zesty, straightforward palate offers white peach, nectarine and green apple alongside bright acidity.",87,20,Central Italy
108830,US,"Dark pink-red in color, this wine has a ripe, sugary nose and a high-octane entry. It grows up to be tangy in citrus peel and fresh grapefruit and cherry, finishing dry.",87,27,California
108840,Italy,"Floral aromas reminiscent of citrus blossom, tuberose and black locust flower lift out of the glass. The bright, straightforward palate offers Bosc pear, lemon drop and toasted hazelnut alongside soft but fresh enough acidity.",87,19,Piedmont
108850,US,"Grapefruit spray and gooseberry aromas jump from the glass initially, with an herbal tomato-leaf tone lingering behind. Lemon-lime acidity cuts through the medium-bodied palate of underripe peach and tropical fruit, leading to a talc-dusted finish. This is zesty, lively and perfectly enjoyable as an apéritif or paired alongside tangy cheese.",87,24,Virginia
108860,Italy,"Aromas of scorched earth, game, dried rose petal and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. The aromas follow through to the solid palate together with overripe black cherry, bitter walnut and a confectionary note alongside grainy tannins. It's a bit rustic but still has an earthy appeal.",87,45,Veneto
108870,US,"This 100% Chardonnay méthode Champenoise sparkler shows aromas of golden apple and yellow pear studded with cherry blossoms. The orchard fruits follow through to a rounded palate, housing medium-beaded bubbles and ample weight. A lemon pastry note adds welcome complexity to the finish.",87,16,America
108880,US,"Big, ripe and juicy, with some overripenes veering into raisins, but it gives a rich plummy edge to the wild berries, tobacco and spice. Drink this impressive Zinfandel with roasts and beef stews.",88,30,California
108890,Portugal,"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe fa?ade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this. In the meantime, it is a winter wine, its concentration needing rich meat dishes.",88,25,Alentejano
108900,Italy,"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles.",85,,Veneto
108910,US,"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of jasmine and pear occasionally poking through and the alcohol showing itself. It's medium sweet (2.7% residual sugar) finishing a touch bitter.",84,10,Idaho
108920,Italy,Fragrant Malvasia tones of honey and white jasmine open the bouquet of this easy-going sparkling wine. The bubbling is light and delicate and the wine ends on a sweet note of Golden Delicious apple.,84,15,Central Italy
108930,US,"Aromas of toast, burnt coffee, mocha, vanilla, herbs and cherry take the lead on this wine. The milk chocolate and cherry flavors are elegant yet rich in style, with the oak at times seeming a little overweighted.",88,28,Washington
108940,South Africa,"Floral aromas of violet, carnation and rose water open the bouquet of this wine, framing the core of muddled black berries and cherries. The texture is tighter and more restrained than anticipated, with astringent tannins and prominent acidity lending a young, firm impression to the palate. Notes of leather and bramble carry the medium-length finish. Try after 2016.",88,38,Stellenbosch
108950,US,"Velvety and rich aromas of chocolate and dried plums are cut with a citrus tartness on the nose of this single-vineyard expression from a historic site near the Gilroy Golf Course. The refreshing if slightly reductive palate offers flavors of espresso and blueberry-crusted beef, enlivening the tongue before washing away.",88,28,California
108960,Italy,"Raw oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean aromas carry over to the palate along with licorice and espresso but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent, grainy tannins clench the bracing finish.",85,60,Piedmont
108970,France,"Scents of violet, brambly berry and blackcurrant leaf lead the bouquet of this earthy blend, with a light gamy character in the background. The palate is bright and lively, with attractive freshness and fine tannins that result in a clean, juicy finish.",85,10,France Other
108980,Argentina,"Powdery, soapy aromas are exotic but not fully convincing. Fresh but nothing more than wet and basic on the palate, this shows briny flavors of orange rind through the finish.",85,15,Other
108990,Portugal,"This has intense pink color with attractive acidity, plenty of sweet strawberry flavors and the merest hint of spirit. Light and bright, it's attractive, clean and fruity. Pink and rosé Ports—Ruby blends with limited exposure to the grape skins—are best served chilled and in cocktails.",88,,Port
109000,Germany,"Hints of nuts and pressed apple lend a savory tone to the nose of this off-dry Riesling, but the palate is fresh and fruity with crisp peach and apricot flavors. Tingly lemon-lime acidity jolts the palate towards a long, mineral-kissed finish.",88,28,Mosel
109010,France,"Lively, crisp and fragrant, this offers fresh acidity and a fruit salad of flavors, along with a creamy textured mousse. With its slight spiciness, it's best as an apéritif.",88,19,Alsace
109020,New Zealand,"A big style that manages to avoid tasting rustic or heavy. Starts with baked pastry shell, black cherry and plum, then adds in hints of licorice and black pepper. Could use a touch more richness in the midpalate, but closes nicely, with fresh acidity that perks up the fruit flavors.",87,33,Marlborough
109030,Italy,"This Sangiovese has a lot going for it: a sweet maple-tinged aroma, a pretty ruby color, round but snappy plum and raspberry flavors, and a long, layered finish. But in the end it doesn't really sing, it's a bit hollow at the core, and there's an oak-driven, buttered popcorn note on the finish that leaves a heavy, lasting flavor.",87,30,Tuscany
109040,New Zealand,"The nose is grassy and full of grapefruit. In a word, it's a sharp bouquet. The mouth offers more of that grassiness and touches of green apple and lemon zest. The finish is smooth enough, and it fades off the palate nicely. A touch of spritz keeps things lively.",87,17,Marlborough
109050,Italy,"This is a modern, plump rendition of Amarone, with soft lines and chewy aromas of black cherry, chocolate fudge, cinnamon and blackberry preserves that are immediate and upfront. The rich, velvety texture make this a great candidate for pairing with wintery cheese fondue.",93,88,Veneto
109060,Italy,"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Merlot, this is a landmark bottling because many years ago it demonstrated that great international-style wines could be made elsewhere in Italy—not only in Tuscany. A celebrated star of the Veneto, this oak-aged red offers enormous density and intensity, with soft, velvety layers and bright aromas of red fruit, spice and dried sage. The finish is characterized by savory, herbal notes that are fresh and tantalizing.",93,100,Veneto
109070,France,"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",93,94,Burgundy
109080,France,"This is soft, full of ripe white fruit flavors. The wine is broad, showing some freshness along with the forward richness. It is likely to age relatively quickly.",87,49,Burgundy
109090,Italy,"Tolloy brings us a bright and luminous Pinot Grigio with a very attractive price tag. You'll recognize aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and kiwi and the wine would pair with tuna or curry chicken salad.",87,13,Northeastern Italy
109100,US,"This is a second wine from Amici Cellars. It's rich and forward with cherry, blackberry, licorice and mocha flavors that taste fruity-sweet, but finish dry. Elegantly constructed, it's a polished wine to drink now.",88,23,California
109110,US,"The Stoller-sourced Pinot is forward and ripe, with pretty fruit flavors in a compact, light vintage. Cola, peach, black cherry and milk chocolate components swirl together, fading gently into a light finish. Drink over the next 2?? years.",88,50,Oregon
109120,US,"Good price for a nice wine that shows some real Pinot character. The mouthfeel is light and silky, and fine acidity gives a bit to the red stone fruits and berries.",86,11,California
109130,France,"This lemon- and pear-flavored wine has an attractive, fresh fruitiness, tight acidity and a very crisp feeling. It is light and bright.",86,14,Loire Valley
109140,US,"The combination of mouthwatering acidity, steely flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, white flowers and honey, and finesse make this slightly oaked Albari?o super drinkable. With a trace of honey, it will be perfect with Vietnamese fare, smoky ham dishes, or fried chicken with potato salad.",86,25,California
109150,Austria,"While this Grüner does not give away too much on its rather closed nose, the savory hints of pepper, arugula, pear and thyme unite beautifully and insistingly on the midpalate. The wine gets full marks for refreshing, authentic typicity.",90,20,Vienna
109160,US,"There's a lightness of being to this wine that makes it ethereal. Light in texture and body, layers of earthy strawberry and red cherry remain crisp and fresh on the palate, with a faint aroma of rose petal marking the bouquet.",90,45,California
109170,US,"This is a big, bold, but welcoming wine with tons of flavor, plenty of tannin but an almost silky texture that invites another sip. The deep red-black color goes almost to the rim. Aromas are like apple skin and red cherries and the flavor suggests blackberries. Its richness without heaviness helps it stand out from the pack.",90,24,California
109180,US,"A big-boned wine with a juicy midpalate, this round, plush expression of the variety offers welcome layers of dark cherry, raspberry and plum nicely accentuated with clove and sage.",90,75,California
109190,Argentina,"Dry spicy aromas accent woodsy berry scents. A tight focused palate jabs with acidity and poking tannins, while this tastes of lightly herbal cherry and berry fruit. Spicy flavors on a healthy finish help this along.",90,20,Mendoza Province
109200,Argentina,"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.",90,55,Mendoza Province
109210,Chile,"Scratchy and dry on the nose, this turns lean and borderline sour in the mouth, with acidity running the show. Very zesty, with mild oak influence, this is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Carmenère.",82,20,Maipo Valley
109220,Chile,"This is nearly indistinguishable from Arauco's standard 82-point 2011 Sauvignon Blanc, smelling stalky, with zero pungency or varietal character. It shows lemony acids, but that's about all.",81,14,Central Valley
109230,Argentina,"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now??017.",96,50,Mendoza Province
109240,France,"Showing its wood strongly, this toasty wine seems to have lost the fruit. Some attractive acidity at the end helps compensate. Drink now.",86,41,Burgundy
109250,Italy,"This wine opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, tire rubber, coffee and mature black fruit. The palate is also dominated by wood sensations, offering oak extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and espresso that smother the hints of ripe black plum that peek through.",86,50,Southern Italy
109260,Spain,"Mild, innocuous aromas of white fruits are pleasant but undefined. This feels round and benefits from acidic lift, while flavors of orange and nectarine finish in a friendly manner. This is mostly Viura with some Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc.",86,10,Central Spain
109270,France,"Pure notes of tart but ripe, red apple shine on nose and palate. They pervade this fresh, clean and dry wine with immense, appetizing juiciness. There is concentration and joy at the heart, backed by focussed, taut acidity that brightens everything. The lemon zest on the finish is impressive and long.",91,54,Alsace
109280,Germany,"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.",91,38,Pfalz
109290,Italy,"Lovely scents of orchard fruit, citrus, almond blossom and a whiff of light baking spice emerge on this radiant wine. The lively, balanced palate delivers yellow apple, bitter almond, ginger and a note of tangerine zest. A salty note closes the finish.",91,40,Northeastern Italy
109300,Portugal,"This is a fruity, wood-aged wine, showing spice and coffee flavors that complement ripe blackberry fruit. It's smooth in texture and has just the right touch of acidity. The wine is ready to drink. Screwcap.",86,9,Tejo
109310,US,"Its brisk acidity and dry, tart lemon-and-lime flavors make this a nice wine to drink now. It has the herb and tobacco notes you often find in Napa Valley Chardonnay.",86,18,California
109320,Spain,"Rough, stalky, yeasty aromas are all over the map. Lemony acidity renders this tight as a drum, while bitter, stalky flavors finish wheaty and bitter. This Tempranillo Blanco is barely worth a go; the pleasure factor is at base level.",81,22,Northern Spain
109330,Chile,"This is fleshy and dilute up front, then heavy and globular in feel. Pickled melon and vegetal stone-fruit flavors finish weak.",80,11,Central Valley
109340,US,"This longstanding collaboration between vintner and grower reflects years of mutual understanding and respect. The wine offers pretty orange blossom and lemon verbena aromas that wrap around a composed, well-integrated and mineral-laden body. Voluptuous, the wine is also well-balanced, finishing in bright acidity. It is deliciously good.",96,65,California
109350,US,"From a newish appellation in El Dorado County, this is a copper-colored wine with richly sweet strawberry flavors and a peppery streak that lasts into the finish. It's dry enough for the dinner table. Try with cioppino. —S.H.",85,10,California
109360,US,"Smells funky, with forest floor, humus and mushroom aromas mingling with riper scents of wild berries and sweet oak. The fruity flavors are well developed, and drink sweetlyripe, yet the wine has a one-dimensionality and is excessively soft. —S.H.",85,23,California
109370,US,"From Chiles Valley, a heady wine with 15.3% alcohol that will appeal to fans of superripe Zin. The plummy flavors veer into Port-like notes of raisins and sweet chocolate, although the wine is fully fermented to dryness.  —S.H.",85,27,California
109380,Spain,"From a good vintage like 2009, this modest Tinta de Toro has a lot to offer. It smells slightly rustic but full of fruit. The palate has a tannic but balanced feel, with dark, sweet flavors of cassis and blackberry. It's peppery and lightly herbal on the finish.",89,15,Northern Spain
109390,Spain,"This opens with a classic Rioja nose of leather, dried cheese, roast berry and spice. It feels chunky and quite solid, with roasted fruit, tomato and herbal flavors on a deep palate. This is long and a touch warm on the finish, but healthy and ready to drink.",89,35,Northern Spain
109400,US,"A soft, gluey Pinot Noir, with almost no structure and bizarre cherry candy and medicinal flavors.",80,18,California
109410,US,"A gigantic wine, one of the most powerful Syrahs in memory. Shows fabulously rich tannins from stem fermentation, sweet, spicy and earthy. The aromas and flavors are of mushrooms, grilled meat, blackberries, cherries, cola, black pepper and smoky cedar. Extraordinary depth and complexity, a very great California Syrah. Could soar off the charts in the next 2?? years.",97,100,California
109420,Portugal,"This soft, almost tasteless wine just hints at caramel and red fruits. It lacks character.",81,15,Lisboa
109430,US,"Just beautiful, this wine combines spicy, arresting aromas, vivid, bright cherry and raspberry flavors, an electric mouthfeel and bracing texture. All nerve and muscle, and no fat, it is vibrant in acidity, with firm tannins that support the enticing fruit flavors. Virtually irresistible now, this will gain complexity through at least 2022.",96,65,California
109440,US,"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",95,52,California
109450,France,"This rich, generous and soft wine has a ripe feel along with plenty of acidity. The freshness is cushioned by ripe yellow and pear fruit flavors. It has power as well as minerality, and a touch of toast comes through at the end. Drink from 2018.",95,69,Burgundy
109460,France,"This is a textured, steely wine with considerable acidity as much as fruit. Tight and with green apple and green plum characters, this structured wine has a salty, chalky texture. Tasting of the soil, it needs to age. Drink from 2018.",95,,Burgundy
109470,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, leather, flint, wild berry and a balsamic note mingle in the glass. The structured palate delivers dried cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Hold for additional complexity; drink 2018??035.",95,90,Piedmont
109480,US,"Fruity and dark, this Bordeaux-style blend is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third a mix of the four other grapes. The result is a wine with stiff tannins and excellent structure, with clean dark-fruit and forest-floor flavors alongside streaks of iron and caramel.",89,20,Washington
109490,Italy,"Not very expressive, this shows subdued aromas that recall coconut, toasted oak, espresso and raw, red berry. The palate delivers red berry, licorice, mocha and vanilla alongside mild tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2015??020.",89,250,Piedmont
109500,Germany,"A whiff of fresh brioche against a backdrop of sunny grapefruit and plum flavors makes this forward fruity off-dry Riesling especially inviting. While lively and crisp, its juicy, quaffable style makes it an easy pleaser. Drink now.",88,11,Mosel
109510,Germany,"Jolts of honey, lemon and lime introduce this animated Sp?tlese. It's forward and approachable with sunny tangerine and peach flavors, but maintains a nervous tension of acidity. The finish is brisk and tight.",88,28,Mosel
109520,Portugal,"From a high-altitude vineyard in the heart of the Douro, this is a fruity while well textured wine. With a strong mineral character that comes from the lees stirring during fermentation, it has both bright citrus fruits with acidity and a more tropical character. Drink now.",88,15,Douro
109530,Spain,"This wine is not impressive in any way. It's tannic, abrasive and tastes stalky and weedy. The finish is rough and green, like rocks in the mouth.",80,30,Northern Spain
109540,US,"The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",94,52,California
109550,Argentina,"Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017.",93,59,Mendoza Province
109560,US,"Chocolate milk, with a squeeze of cassis liqueur and the sweet vanillins of toasted oak, are the flavors. With the high alcohol, it's almost a dessert wine. Give it credit for a heady opulence.",85,39,California
109570,France,"While the aromas have rustic overtones, the wine itself goes down the red fruit path. It shows juicy cherry flavors, soft but present tannins and a good touch of spice and wood. There is an attractive smoky aftertaste. Drink in 2015.",85,,Burgundy
109580,France,"A bold and ripe wine, it's full of black currant fruits accompanied by wood and acidity. It's obviously young and will soften and calm into a smooth and rich wine. The finish brings out a dry character. Drink from 2017.",85,,Bordeaux
109590,US,"These old vines produce a powerful wine, that retains strong flavors of stem and earth despite the extra ripeness in 2012. The red berry fruit slides into suggestions of tomato juice.",87,55,Oregon
109600,Germany,"There's nothing flashy about this dry, delicately framed Riesling. It's quietly elegant, focused on pristine lemon and lime flavors, along with bitter citrus pith on the finish.",87,20,Rheingau
109610,US,"A white Pinot Noir made from estate-grown grapes, this is a curious wine and perhaps an acquired taste, though it has found its fans via the winery. Akin to Chardonnay in its expressions of crème br?lée, tropical fruit basket and tangy apple, this wine is textured, bright in acidity and touched by oak.",87,55,California
109620,US,"Sugary sweet, this blend has jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a sprinkling of chocolate.",82,20,California
109630,US,"Simple and slightly sweet, like the juice from canned peaches, pineapples and apricots, but with more acidity.",82,16,California
109640,France,"The wine has fine potential. While the wood flavors are dominant, as it develops the ripe red-berry flavors that are there will fill out and bring their fruity acidity along. It is going to be ready to drink from 2017.",88,20,Bordeaux
109650,Portugal,"This Port comes from a good year for single-quinta vintages. Made in open stone lagars, it is a ripe, black-fruited wine, packed with sweet plums as well as raisins and figs. At this stage, the added brandy is very prominent and the wine needs time. It should be ready to drink for its fruit by 2018, for its maturity by 2026.",88,84,Port
109660,US,"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core.",88,19,Oregon
109670,Spain,"Peach, melon and vanilla cookie aromas are mild, simple and a touch mealy. The mouthfeel on this basic Albari?o is fleshy and plump, with adequate acidity. Sweet apple and tropical fruit flavors are lasting and stay the course.",85,12,Galicia
109680,Italy,"Aromas of toasted oak and lemon zest carry through to the one-dimensional, lean palate, along with confectionary notes.",85,30,Sicily & Sardinia

109700,France,"Perhaps it is the large Clairette component (52%), but this blend finishes with an attractive tingle of lime that brightens the whole experience. Honeyed melon and traces of raw almond give the impression of softness, yet the wine remains refreshing. The balance is 26% Grenache Blanc, 13% Viognier and 9% Picpoul. Drink it now and over the next six months.",89,19,Rh?ne Valley
109710,Spain,"This mature brut nature is smoky and stalky/bitter on the nose. In the mouth, it's lean and acidic, with little body in support of citrus and gritty apple flavors. Bitterness and white-pepper notes rise up on the finish. For razor-sharp Cava, this fits the bill.",88,59,Catalonia
109720,Italy,"Rose, leather, black cherry and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this friendly wine. The savory palate delivers crushed red berry and white pepper alongside lithe tannins that give it an easy drinking texture.",88,,Tuscany
109730,Chile,"Piercing on the nose, with aromas of cola, graphite, juniper and blackberry. Feels thick, with meaty flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, herb and flower notes. Layered and relatively long on the finish. Impressive for under-$20 Chilean Syrah, with complexity and sauvage notes.",89,16,Cachapoal Valley
109740,US,"A solid example of the variety, with complex red and black fruits mixing it up with additional grace notes of coffee, sweet spice, toast and licorice. It's a balanced effort, with rather delicate tannins, and a finish that quits just a little early.",89,30,Oregon
109750,US,"Cedarville takes a lot of pride in its Cab, and this definitely screams mightily of its mountain, granite-soiled origins, with a rich mouthfeel and rocky minerality. Fully fruity, though restrained, this Cab has plenty of leathery plushness in the midpalate ending with a finale of dense, dark chocolate.",89,29,California
109760,Italy,"Alluring aromas of exotic spice, purple flower, dark-skinned berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The concentrated palate delivers dried cherry, ripe plum, mint, licorice and a hint of game alongside velvety tannins that wrap around the finish. It nicely balances weight and finesse.",93,92,Veneto
109770,France,"Negociant Nicolas Potel has made a specialty of sourcing old vines. In this wine, they are between 44 and 54-years-old. The wine is rich and concentrated—dark with tannins and generous with black fruits. It is firm and obviously needs to age. Drink this sold wine from 2020.",92,64,Burgundy
109780,Spain,"Cherry, plum and oaky aromas of vanilla work well together on this tight, slightly clampy and acidic Gran Reserva that's still showing youthful tannic pull. Ripe plum and spice flavors hint at raisin, while this finishes with grabby tannic intensity. Drink this through 2022.",92,37,Northern Spain
109790,France,"While the style is soft, full of yellow fruit richness, the wine also show an excellent concentrated texture. The fresh fruit is integrated into this more complex style. The aftertaste shows some softness, but the wine can certainly age for several years.",91,92,Champagne
109800,Argentina,"Deep berry, cola, mint and leather aromas are classy and not overdone. Feels lush and deep in the mouth, with blatant ripeness and toasty, oaky flavors of cola, coconut and blackberry. Finishes big but not that long or complex. Drink now through 2013; Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",91,54,Mendoza Province
109810,Italy,"There's a lot of excitement surrounding the little-know Groppello grape that is a native of northern Italy. The variety delivers freshness and fruity intensity: This expression is extremely clean, polished and food-friendly.",87,23,Northeastern Italy
109820,Italy,"Here's a simple, straightforward Cabernet Sauvignon from northern Italy with an attractively low price tag and lively aromas of cherry, chocolate and spice. It shows rich, dense texture as well.",87,12,Veneto
109830,Chile,"Briny aromas of sauerkraut fail to make much of an impression. This is dull in feel, with bitter, fruitless flavors. On the finish, bitterness remains. Drinkable but with few positives.",82,12,Casablanca Valley
109840,Argentina,"Just when you think Alta Vista has gotten everything it can from Temis (see the 2012), this comes along to reset the benchmark. Ripe, round and lush on the nose, with full-force blackberry and prune aromas, this shows titanic grip, depth and ripeness on the palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry finish with hefty tannins and a smear of mocha flavor. Drink from 2018??026.",96,48,Mendoza Province
109850,Portugal,"This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age over many decades. It also offers the rich blackberry, dark plum and great structure that will support that aging. As so often, Noval has released a vintage when other major producers have held back.

109940,Australia,"Wakefield (known as Taylor's in Australia) was founded as a Cabernet-focused estate. While the range has expanded over time, Cabernet Sauvignon remains a strength.

Drink through 2019.",92,25,Northern Spain
109980,France,The nose is very restrained: barely an aroma escapes. The palate comes in with shy reticent freshness but reveals a serious vein of grapefruit zestiness underneath. This has ample freshness that needs to be teased out. The finish is dry and clean.,89,17,Alsace
109990,France,"Tight and crisply fruity, this wine comes from a property in the Vignobles Signé family since 1649. With a strong herbal character, it is refreshing and already delicious, bright and lively. Plenty of acidity keeps this wine packed with forward fruit. Drink now.",89,12,Bordeaux

110110,Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.??It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose.

110120,Italy,"Here is an organic Merlot with well-integrated spice, fresh fruit nuances and natural rubber (a tiny touch of Band-Aid is present as well).

Enjoy now for its lavish perfume and fruit, but even more from 2020 for intense textural complexity.",93,95,Mosel
110510,France,"This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive.

110770,US,It's not clear what separates this from some of the other estate-grown cuvées. The thin strawberry fruit accompanies rather stemmy tannins and a green vegetal streak.,85,45,Oregon
110780,US,"The nose of this bottling is quite shy. After being open for hours, it begins to show dust and soil aromas, like sun-baked clay, crushed rocks and flint. The palate is also hard to decipher, with a little blackberry fruit but mostly dry, flat soil flavors.",85,20,California
110790,US,"Exceedingly dark, with chewy herbal tannins and high-toned somewhat volatile aromas, this is a wine that has not knit together. Black cherry, kirsch, fig and balsamic elements are scattered about, but nothing holds the center. Best to drink up soon.",85,32,Oregon

110940,US,"A soft, simple, fruity Merlot. Tastes like a cherry, blackberry, roasted almond, cocoa and cinnamon granola bar, melted into wine.",83,10,California
110950,US,"Lots of good acidity in this clean wine, with stimulating flavors of lemons, limes and gooseberries. There's a sour taste of feline emission that will turn some people off.",83,14,California
110960,US,"Earthy and thin, this has little in the way of fruit flavor or varietal character. Stemmy tannins and sour acids leave an impression of a dilute, unripe wine.",82,25,Oregon
110970,Georgia,"Honey gold in color, this wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has a bouquet of white cherries and lavender. Tart flavors of honeydew melon and white plum persist into the soft floral finish.",84,28,Georgia
110980,France,"A light, bright and fruity wine from the Lafite stable, this is a fine apéritif style. Crisp green fruitiness comes with a hint of a more steely character. It is ready to drink.",84,18,Bordeaux
110990,Spain,"This Bobal's roasted berry and funky animal aromas hardly lay down the red carpet. Its dry spice and oak flavors smother berry and plum fruit, tasting herbal and minty on a heavy, grippy finish.",84,20,Central Spain
111000,US,"Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish.",87,22,California
111010,US,"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",87,22,California
111020,France,"Built along traditional lines, this claret features soft plummy Merlot fruit accented by leafy tobacco and cassis. Its cedary leanness makes it an ideal foil for rich meat dishes.",86,15,Bordeaux
111030,US,"This small, family-owned, biodynamically farmed vineyard and winery is quickly becoming a southern Oregon cult producer. Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors. Then the spices pile on, lending an exotic twist to a lengthy midpalate, and leading into a lightly toasty finish.",93,30,Oregon
111040,Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",93,,Rheingau
111050,Italy,"Poggio Argentato opens with a bright bouquet of green apple, kiwi, cut grass and lemon zest. You'll also recognize green caper and olive notes on the finish. The wine shows good density, freshness and would pair with smoked salmon and cream cheese.",87,20,Tuscany
111060,Argentina,"Opens with berry fruit aromas, density and slightly medicinal notes. Feels bright and lively, with ample acidity pushing toasty, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Shows mild spice, licorice and barrel notes on the finish, along with herbal notes. Seems like a very good everyday or value-driven choice.",87,13,Mendoza Province
111070,US,"Made in an oxidized style like a Sherry from Spain, ROX is meant to be drunk as an apéritif with raw oysters or hard, stinky cheeses and cured meats. An interesting almond-flavored take on Sierra Foothills-grown Roussanne grapes for sure.",87,20,California
111080,US,"This interesting wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon that seems to give it a bit of needed power. Still, it's soft and melted. While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.",88,52,California
111090,US,"This new Shea designate is focused and appealing, with streaks of cola and vanilla running through the pretty cranberry and strawberry fruit. It's balanced and nicely textured, with a dollop of moist earth accenting the tannins.",88,58,Oregon
111100,Italy,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed berry, violet and a whiff of menthol. The juicy palate offers black cherry, white pepper and licorice alongside firm but fine-grained tannins.",88,25,Tuscany
111110,France,"This yeasty, ripe and fruity wine is given great shape by the mineral-taut texture. It is on the dry side, crisp with well-structured apples and pears. The bready character gives extra richness and balances the tight acidity at the end.",88,40,Champagne
111120,Italy,"Produced with Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Mammolo, this opens with subtle aromas of turned soil, ripe plum and dark cooking spice. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, coffee, oak and a leathery note accompanied by solid tannins.",88,28,Tuscany

111150,France,"89-91 This has weight, dark tannins, very taut and mineral. Spice comes from the wood.",90,,Bordeaux
111160,Portugal,"Auru is a play on the word Ouro, gold, from the Rio Douro, or river of gold. The wine is only made in the best years. It is a complete wine, with its spice and wood character just one element in the mix of sweet fruits, tight tannins and layers of acidity. It could well age over the next 3?? years.",93,,Douro
111170,Spain,"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",93,62,Northern Spain
111180,US,"Rather spare despite the cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are ultralight, and the acidity you'd expect from this cool coastal appellation isn't there. That leaves alcohol and fruit and a certain flabbiness.",84,18,California
111190,US,"Decent, with ripe flavors of cherries and spice, dry tannins and good acidity. Yes, it's a common wine, made for everyday consumption, but you can't drink expensive stuff every day. This will do in a pinch, or for your next block party.",84,10,California
111200,France,"Firm and dry, it's packed with as much tannin as fruit. It has a dark, structured character that's shot through with mint and black currant flavors. The aftertaste is dense and solid. Drink from 2017.",88,22,Bordeaux
111210,Australia,"This crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet.",88,42,Victoria

111250,Italy,"Dark, inky and thick, this hearty Brunello begs for grilled steak. It opens with ripe fruit—blackberry, plum and prune—and has a background rendering of spice, leather and cigar box. It shows a big, bold style, with loads of soft density and opulence. Good structure, too. Drink after 2015.",93,60,Tuscany

111270,Australia,"Full bodied and richly tannic, Lehmann's 2006 Mentor is dark, chocolaty and intense, with further nuances of cassis and cigar box. The finish is chewy and juicy, simultaneously drying and mouthwatering. Drink 2015??023.",92,38,South Australia

111290,US,"Medium bodied and soft in texture, this wine has a pale, brownish-gold color, butter and vanilla flavors, and a lingering vanilla finish.",86,16,California
111300,Chile,"Plum and animal aromas are okay. A chunky, rubbery palate is full but lacking in shape and nuance. This tastes of peppery plum and berry in front of a limited finish with notes of hard spice and berry fruits.",85,13,Central Valley
111310,US,"Soft and gentle, but rich in cherry and red currant flavors, this has the rich, umami flavor of a lightly salted and peppered rare hamburger. Pair it with a burger, and leave off the cheese.",89,38,California
111320,US,"Appealing for its sheer wealth of flavor, this is very rich and forward, with notes of jammy red cherries, red currants and mocha. It's a little soft and sweet, and it doesn't seem to have the structure for the long term. Drink now??015.",89,64,California
111330,US,"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins. On the finish, it has a leathery tobacco note, with the richness of a cinnamon roll. Enjoy this with meaty dishes.",89,32,California
111340,US,"This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find.",91,28,California
111350,Germany,"Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish.",91,25,Mosel

111370,Chile,"Heat and earthy, leathery aromas are the initial blast here. This is a zesty, raw Pinot with punchy, tart raspberry and red plum flavors. Throughout this runs bright and juicy, with tangy acidity creating a citrus-like finish.",85,12,Curicó Valley
111380,Italy,"This Barolo shows roasted coffee notes and a whisper of prune, with lots of oak on top. It's very dry, tannic and tough on the palate. Still young, but it lacks fruit flavors and balance.",84,60,Piedmont
111390,Australia,"Peaches and white flowers make for a very seductive first act. The full-bodied palate lacks a bit of concentration but offers up appealing notes of canned peaches, pears and apricots. Slightly short but tasty finish. Drink now.",86,16,South Australia
111400,Italy,"Firriato delivers textbook Grillo (a grape native to Sicily) with soothing, rich texture and aromas of nectarine and pear that are not too intense, but strong enough to recall the Mediterranean's sunshine and warmth. The wine would pair well with seafood risotto or baked clams.",86,15,Sicily & Sardinia
111410,US,"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",87,30,California
111420,Italy,"Ripe notes of cherry, black fruit, dried apple skin and tobacco leaf appear on the nose of this Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Marzemino blend. The wine is chewy and dense in the mouth but there's a slightly bitter note on the close that comes as a surprise.",87,62,Veneto
111430,US,"This limited-edition Pinot Gris was barrel-fermented and aged sur lie. It broadens out the palate and adds layers of buttered popcorn, caramel and toasted hazelnuts to the apple and pear fruit flavors.",87,22,Oregon
111440,US,"Tastes like fruit-based syrup, with cherry and spice flavors. Lacks vivacity.",82,28,California

111460,France,"This wine is crisp and packed with both acidity and lively citrus fruits, balanced between fruit and freshness. It makes a good apéritif wine, light and very much in balance. The mostly red-wine property, owned by Régis and Hervé Grandeau, sits on a slope above the Right Bank of the Garonne River only four miles from Bordeaux city.",88,12,Bordeaux
111470,France,"Steel and nervy mineralogy are the hallmarks of this wine at this stage. It's still waiting for the fruit to develop, but expect crisp citrus and succulent apples. The aftertaste, tensely fresh now, should soften as the wine develops. This 90% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Sémillon blend comes from the estate's small vineyard on the slope near Cadillac.",88,12,Bordeaux
111480,Italy,"This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of red berry, tilled earth, underbrush and dried herb. The firm palate doles out black cherry, plum, licorice and crushed mint alongside modest acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",88,18,Tuscany
111490,Austria,Flinty highlights join lemon zest freshness on a thrillingly pure and streamlined palate bursting with lemon and tangerine zest. This is taut and slender but packs a citrus punch. This is destined for hot days; it is lovely now but will also last. Some spritz enlivens the finish. Drink Now till 2020.,92,25,Traisental
111500,Spain,"Pure cherry, blackberry and plum aromas are dense, toasty, minerally and smoky. Intense plum and blackberry flavors soften a bit on a loamy, lightly baked finish.

111520,US,"You'll find luxuriously ripe apricot, pineapple, white currant and peach flavors in this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Chardonnay. It's a bit stewed in fruit, though, and ready to drink now with sweetish fare.",85,40,California
111530,Austria,"Light-bodied, straightforward red, with blackberry aromas, this wine could be accentuated with chilling and is a solution for cuisine such as mixed charuterie platters or liver terrines. A friendly, uncomplicated red made for the moment, with gracious, cheerful fruitiness.",85,10,Nieder?sterreich
111540,US,"Hints of spice lend an exotic feel to aromas of freshly pressed apples on this Riesling. It's off dry in style with ripe, juicy white-grapefruit flavor accented with piercingly high acidity. Finishes briskly on a slightly bitter note.",85,16,New York
111550,Spain,"A Barcelona-based brand with this Bierzo label that's good, with generic red-fruit aromas and cheesy smelling oak. Feels light, snappy and feminine, with spicy, resiny flavors along with tart raspberry and tomato. Ends abruptly.",86,18,Northern Spain

111580,US,"Buttery vanilla and baked cherry aromas make for a pretty and plump entry to this bottling from a vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Approachable plum and cherry flavors meet baking spice on the palate, the texture soft and acidity ample.",90,65,California
111590,New Zealand,"A concentrated, medium-bodied wine, this is a fine example of Marlborough and the variety. Hints of passion fruit lend regional typicity, while the core of the wine is built around white grapefruit flavors that finish long and mouthwatering.",90,26,Marlborough
111600,US,"This bottling has been variable over the decades, but this 2010 shows fine form, a good sign coming on the heels of the excellent 2009. It's richly oaked and flashy in pineapple jam, buttered toast and creamy, yeasty flavors.",90,30,California
111610,US,"The vineyard, which is in St. Helena, certainly yielded grapes that were ripe, to judge by this wine's flavors. It's gigantic in berries, cherries, mocha and spices that are jammy and sweet. The best thing about it are the tannins, which are smooth and complex. Give this flashy young Petite Sirah a couple years to integrate and mellow.",90,65,California
111620,US,"A little rough in the mouth, with a scoury feeling. But it's extraordinarily rich in orange and lime flavors, with the vanilla and yeasty dough accents you want in a nice sparkling wine.",89,45,California

111670,France,"From vines on the slopes of Mont Saint-Victoire, this wine has a cool, bright feeling. Citrus fruits and attractive acidity integrate well with its more tangy texture.

111680,US,"This appellation blend by celebrated winemaker Sabrine Rodems shows cranberry fruit, bergamot peel, woody chaparral and mushroom on the nose.

111690,US,"The nose on this bottling is immensely intriguing and unique, with gooseberry, grapefruit skin, wet river stone and the faintest whiff of serrano chili.

111700,US,"Opening aromatically effusive as a rose garden, this wine takes on darker, thicker overtones of baked strawberry rhubarb as a heaviness of tannin and oak permeates the midpalate. Its youthful power should mellow as an underlying, almost carbonic freshness lurks.",91,44,California
111710,Germany,"Opulent tropical fruit and florals perfume this decadently ripe yet bracing wine. It's intensely fruity and juicy yet spine tingling with acidity. Blossom and honey notes leave a lingering, pleasantly viscous trail of sweetness on the palate. Delightful now but likely to hold through 2022.",91,24,Mosel
111720,France,"With very herbal aromas, this wood-aged red has a green quality that detracts from the riper red fruit flavors. Acidity and firm tannins do add structure. It needs time to fully integrate, so drink from 2015.",88,35,Loire Valley

111760,France,"Dense, yes, but this is also a handsome wine that balances complex tannins with pure black currant fruits that shine.

The greatness of the wine shows in its purity with a deceptive simplicity that hides the final complex tannins and structure.",98,,Bordeaux
111770,France,"There is a heavy wood presence in this wine. For now, it dominates with burnt toast and dark chocolate flavors. Happily, the fruit is also developing well, bringing its fresh black-currant flavors into the balance. Drink this still-young wine from 2020.",90,25,Bordeaux
111780,France,"Everything here is just hinted at: a touch of tropical fruit on the nose, a faint note of nougat on the palate and a spritz of lemon over the biscuity backdrop. There is structure, dryness and backbone, all held in a tight package that has a long-echoing aftertaste.",90,29,Alsace

111830,US,"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.",91,50,California
111840,France,"Morel, the general manager at M. Chapoutier, also has his own label, which includes this very attractive wine from Sign?argues, the southernmost villages appellation of the C?te du Rh?ne.

111870,US,"This is a big, tannic and dry Syrah that seems built for the cellar, but an unripe note of green peppercorn verging on bell pepper rules that out. So drink now and appreciate the blackberries and oak.",86,38,California
111880,Argentina,"Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.",85,9,Mendoza Province
111890,Italy,"Il Drappo is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that has been aged carefully in oak to produce a soft, rich mouthfeel and lively notes of bright berry and savory spice. There's a touch of toasted pistachio nut as well.",90,40,Sicily & Sardinia

111910,Italy,"Aromas of dark berry, blue flower, baking spice and a whiff of forest floor come together in the glass. The vibrant palate starts off with wild cherry, clove and sage but then loses some steam midpalate. Fine-grained but not very persistent tannins offer support. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink through 2016??020.",88,45,Tuscany

111950,France,"This wine is dry, structured and heavily extracted. That leaves a bitter note behind the fruit and acidity. It could have benefited from more gentle winemaking, and although it will soften with age, it will always be tough.",85,18,Bordeaux
111960,US,"Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines designed to showcase a specific Napa Valley appellation, this one shines in juicy black licorice and dark cherry. Expansive on the palate, it's bright and minerality-driven, with a flourish of coconut and vanilla on the finish.",93,85,California
111970,France,"The lifted, pure scent of damask rose after rain hits you first. It is then joined by riper notions of Mirabelle but always with fresh, airy lift. While the palate weighs this down with perceptible sweetness, the aromas rise unfettered. This is a beautiful wine singing with rose and orange aromatics that persist with a lingering perfume.",93,55,Alsace
111980,US,"A rich, decadent and generous wine, 100% varietal, this is both floral and fruity, bright in cherry and raspberry alongside herbal cedar and vanilla.

111990,France,"The blend of Colombard, Gros Manseng and Sauvignon Blanc gives a light mineral character. The wine is very fresh, very crisp and finely layered, with a depth of herbaceous and green fruit flavors. Screwcap.",88,,Southwest France
112000,France,"The dominance of young Sémillon in the blend gives considerable herbaceousness. The wine has a fresh, grassy character, its acidity offering freshness within the full texture.",88,25,Southwest France
112010,US,"An earthy, light Mendocino Pinot from a fabulous vintage that's got all the cherry, dusty mushroom flavors one could want, with a smidgen of black pepper on the finish. The bottle's suggestion to pair with Coq au Vin is a good one.",88,19,California

112070,Italy,"This has intense forest-floor aromas, a hint of violet along and toasted oak and vanilla notes. The palate shows bright raspberry and espresso flavors, nervous acidity and firm tannins. It needs time, so drink after 2016.",88,60,Piedmont
112080,US,"Syrah in Washington can assume many shapes; here it shows many elements of the forest floor—dried leaves, moist earth, hints of mushroom. It seems to be locked down at the moment, the green tea tannins forming a shell around the tart fruit. Bound to improve dramatically with further bottle age.",88,30,Washington
112090,France,"Bright and fruity, this wine has fine acidity, which balances the firm tannins. The whole wine feels juicy, packed with forward fruit and having a lively character. Drink now.",88,16,Bordeaux

112120,US,"This looks, smells and tastes so young that it might have come right out of the fermenting tank. It is tight to the point of reductive, with tart fruit flavors of cranberry and rhubarb, and stiff, chalky tannins.",86,50,Oregon
112130,Australia,"This medium-bodied white features attractive scents of lime zest and pineapple. On the palate, the flavors veer toward apple and citrus, which fade rapidly on the finish. Drink now.",87,15,South Australia
112140,Spain,"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",87,18,Northern Spain
112150,Italy,"Toast, violet and plum aromas lead the way and carry over to the inviting palate along with mature blackberry, vanilla and cinnamon. Dusty tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018.",88,28,Northeastern Italy

112180,Portugal,"Following a Bordeaux model, this is the second wine of Romaneira. Named after the bell that hangs at the entrance to the quinta, it is a ripe, lightly structured wine that is ready to mature quickly. Berry fruits and acidity give the wine its main character. Drink from 2017.",88,20,Douro
112190,Portugal,The Cabernet Sauvignon structure shows strongly in this firm wine. Mint and black currant flavors are dense and concentrated. The tannins give a dry character to the wine that contrasts with its fruitiness. Drink from 2017.,88,9,Península de Setúbal

112210,France,"Sancerre's near-neighbor produces wines in a similar style, although with less intensity. That gives this attractive, fruity rosé from Pinot Noir a fresh, light step. Crisp raspberry and red currant acidity cuts through brightly. Drink now.",85,20,Loire Valley
112220,US,"Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.",85,29,California
112230,US,This soft and slightly sweet wine smells like cinnamon and vanilla and tastes like cherry juice. It is medium bodied and smooth in texture.,84,8,California
112240,France,To age an extra brut vintage before release is a great idea. It leaves a wine that hints at toasty aromas as well as still-crisp fruitiness. The apple and pear flavors are filled out by the tangy edge and the hints of maturity to come. Drink this fine vintage now.,93,67,Champagne
112250,France,"Produced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards in the C?te des Blancs, this is a beautiful, dry wine. It has a chalky texture and ample acidity that frames the tight fruit. The pure line of citrus and crisp green apples goes right to the heart of this balanced, bright wine that will age well. Drink now for the forward fruit, or wait for another two to three years.",93,79,Champagne
112260,France,This ripe wine is still young. It has a taut texture that's dominated by the lively white fruit and crisp acidity. There's a mineral streak that cuts through the wine to give a steely texture that will soften over the next year. Drink from the end of 2018.,93,65,Champagne

112280,US,"A robust, very ripe style of red wine, this is deep in color and packed with fruity flavors that tend toward prune and raisin. A taste of celery comes up on the finish. Though not high in alcohol it feels full-bodied and rich in texture, and rather heavy.",85,28,California
112290,US,"This has a reductive nose, with stewed blackberry giving a fruity side to the barnyard-y aromas. The flavors are earthy and savory, with some cigar box surrounding it all, but not tons of fruit.",85,22,California
112300,US,"An unusually deep color and black-cherry flavors help make this wine concentrated and full bodied. A thick layer of tannins puckers the mouth, but will help the wine pair with a roast or rich risotto. It's made from 76% Grenache and 24% Syrah.",87,36,California
112310,Italy,"Bright and simple, this has delicate aromas of white stone fruit. The easygoing palate offers white peach and fresh apricot alongside fresh acidity.",86,25,Sicily & Sardinia
112320,US,"A steely mouthfeel and tight lemon and herb flavors make this full-bodied wine refreshing, dry and reserved. It will make a good accompaniment to shellfish or pasta.",86,18,California
112330,France,"A floral freshness hovers above the lemony notes on the nose. It is those concentrated, clean but ripe and pure lemon notes that totally inform the slender and dry palate. This is light but has real impact. Its fruity core reveals some fresh apple notes on the long, clean and refreshing finish. Drink now through 2025 at least.",92,17,Alsace
112340,US,"Light blackberry aromas mix with dried dill and pepper on the nose of this bottling from an appellation known for its ageworthy Syrahs. The palate's lively black fruit is well spiced with thyme, black pepper and more wild herbs.",92,30,California
112350,Portugal,"Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine. Full of tannins and with a strongly mineral texture (you can almost taste the dirt), it is solid with rich fruit, acidity and hints of wood aging. This powerful wine needs to age another year, so drink from 2018.",92,25,Douro
112360,US,"This seems designed to appeal to the Moscato-loving crowd. It has sweet flavors, with apricot and tangerine notes that taste like fruit juice.",82,12,California
112370,US,"As its name states quite clearly, this is a plush, lush, smooth red wine. It's sweet and jammy like a shot of Jell-O.",81,8,California
112380,Argentina,"This is saturated, flat and flabby on the nose, with pudgy blackberry aromas. It has a static, jammy mouthfeel, tasting overspiced and heavily oaked.",80,12,Mendoza Province
112390,France,"This wine opens with an explosion of Granny Smith apples underlined by firm minerality. The honeyed palate shows nice grapefruit and lemon character. Medium, citrus finish. Best now, but will gain complexity over three to four years.",88,30,Alsace
112400,US,"Ballentine consistently makes one of the best Chenins in California, and while this 2009 seems rushed to market, it's a good alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio. Shows bright, zesty acidity framing citrus, green bean and wildflower flavors, and the finish is totally dry.",87,15,California

112420,France,"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan delivers just what you'd expect from the appellation, it just does it better than most, at a modest price.

112430,US,"The grapes for this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle are nearly equally sourced from three vineyards: Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and CoCaVin. The nose is herbal with sagebrush, oregano and thyme, offering just a bit of black plum fruit. The palate is also full of crushed, dried herbs, proving a touch sour and tarry, with cooked strawberry and dried raspberry fruit.",88,28,California
112440,US,"A massive wine that absolutely demands time in the cellar, Lancaster's '05 is nearly all Cabernet, with tiny amounts of the other four Bordeaux varieties. It stuns with the power and authenticity of its hilly Cabernet origins, offering vast black currant, orange rind, anise and smoky oak flavors that implode on the palate. But the tannins are hard. It should blossom and fully come into its own after 2010.",95,70,California
112450,Italy,"This is one of the best Taurasis of all times. Antonio Caggiano has crafted an elegant wine that is rich in charm and personality. Cherry, freshly milled espresso, natural rubber, white truffle, pecorino cheese and black mineral all play a part in this complex ensemble. It has thick, tight tannins with beautifully etched mineral nuances and should age well for many years in the cellar. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",94,60,Southern Italy
112460,Spain,"Pungent, grassy and ultrafresh, with citric aromas and textbook scents of wild grass, nettles and passionfruit.

The feel is wet and flashy, and overall this is a very nice wine to match with salads, fish and the like.",89,18,Northern Spain
112470,Australia,"Mixed aromas of vanilla, Christmas spices and brandied black cherries give an almost dessert-like impression, although the wine is technically dry. The texture is creamy and luxurious, and the wine is very easy to drink despite its considerable weight, balanced by a tart edge of acid on the finish. Drink now??012.",89,19,South Australia
112480,US,"This wine has the magic mix of vanilla, tobacco and cherry that many consumers (and critics) love. It's a seductive Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, with a little bit of Yakima Valley Merlot blended in. With more time it may flesh out and show better depth to the fruit, but it's quite enjoyable as is.",89,30,Oregon
112490,US,"Golden in color, this wine otherwise exhibits a low amount of well-integrated oak, letting the crisper elements of pear and lime shine through. Medium bodied, it's a tight, focused wine that finishes dry and complete.",88,32,California
112500,US,"A white Meritage of just over 53% Sauvignon Blanc with the remainder Sémillon, aged in neutral French oak, this wine has a full body and a balance of crispness and weight. Lemon, lime, pear and honeydew melon highlight the aromas and flavors, finishing with length.",88,20,California

112520,Italy,"Aromas of blackcurrant, spice, menthol, espresso and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The round, chewy palate doles out blackberry jam, licorice, ground black pepper and coffee alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's evolving quickly so enjoy sooner rather than later.",88,36,Tuscany
112530,France,"Earthy and rustic, this intensely tannic wine has a dry character. The fruit is all there, hiding behind this rough exterior. Allow the wine time to soften out and drink from 2018.",88,35,Burgundy
112540,US,"Fig and fennel star in this block-designated white that is crisp and fresh around a medium-strength body. Ready for the table, it finishes quick and clean.",88,25,California
112550,Italy,"Aromas of vanilla, toast, mocha and plum come together in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, toasted oak and oak-driven spices but the fruit flavors are already drying up.",88,37,Tuscany
112560,New Zealand,"Some leathery, clove-like notes spice up this solidly built Pinot. Hints of briar add more complexity to the cherry fruit, before some drying tannins take over on the finish. Rather than aging this to mellow the tannins, try it alongside beef or lamb instead.",88,25,Central Otago
112570,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in 60% new French oak, this wine shows a pleasing mixture of fruit and barrel, intermingling aromas of toast, stone and tropical fruit, spice and butter. Flavors are light and elegant, but show a pleasing sense of balance.",88,45,Washington
112580,Portugal,"A firm, tannic wine with elegant structure. The red fruits from the Merlot are a great foil for the tannins of the Touriga Franca. Even at five years, this is still fruit dominated, although the wood and spice element is well integrated.",88,,Estremadura
112590,US,"This is a very good Pinot Noir that shows how well the appellation can balance the variety. It has lush cherry, blackberry, tea, cola and cocoa flavors, and a rich, silky texture. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",88,25,California
112600,South Africa,An easy and approachable quaff with standard notes of cassis and black plum throughout. A touch of spice and licorice keeps things interesting and remain present through the medium-length close.,86,13,Stellenbosch
112610,Italy,"Compared to past vintages, this expression of Moscato d'Asti offers aromas of dried grass and hay backed by peach blossom, lemon and spring flowers. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy rich.",86,16,Piedmont
112620,Argentina,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",85,10,Mendoza Province
112630,Italy,"This naturally rich Soave Classico opens with floral, soapy aromas of honeysuckle and yellow rose. The texture is dense and heavy, although a fresh acidic component helps keep it balanced.",85,,Veneto
112640,France,"Soft caramel aromas lead to a light, fresh wine with attractive red berry fruits. It is an easy style, only a touch of texture. Screwcap.",84,11,Provence
112650,Chile,"Slightly heavy and saucy, with a bit of cooked fruit and lemony oak to the nose. But it's not over-the-top baked or overoaked, so there's still some black-fruit quality to mine as well as decent chocolate and mocha on the finish. Hardly elegant, but by the same token it's not wanting for gusto.",84,9,San Clemente
112660,US,"This smells??and remarkably it also tastes—like bubble gum, with some pineapple tossed in for good measure. Peaches and apricots? Not so much; this is definitely an atypical Viognier, but brings plenty of candied fruit to the table.",84,20,Oregon
112670,Germany,"Terrific, from its nearly indefinable aromas akin to Cloud Ear fungus to its intensely sweet yet racy palate. Dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors give it substance without excessive weight, finishing long and intense. Drink now??030.",95,142,Rheingau
112680,US,"This is a frankly delicious young Cabernet, hailing from a small vineyard to showcase its qualities. It's deeply flavored in blackberries and currants, with the most delicious dark chocolate sweetness. Yet it also has the tannic backbone to last. It's one of those wines you can drink now, or age for at least six years to see what it can do.",94,115,California
112690,US,"A selection of the best lots of the vintage, here sourced entirely from biodynamically-farmed blocks of the Maresh Vineyard in the Dundee Hills. Among the most Burgundian of all Oregon Pinots, this complex, cellar-ready wine shows ripe red and black fruits, old vine hints of dried leaves, light herb and autumnal profundity.",94,32,Oregon
112700,Portugal,"As often with wines that have some Baga in the blend, rusticity fights with elegance. In this case, elegance is winning as the wine ages. The herbal element is important as is the sweet jelly fruit.",86,11,Bairrada
112710,US,"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with cocktail appetizers, like mushroom puff pastry or veggie tempura. A little sweet in lime and guava fruit, it's rich in acidity.",86,18,California
112720,US,"Greenwood's Merlot-Zinfandel blend is a nod to vintner-in-chief Allan Green's Dragons baseball team and would be so fun to recommend to baseball lovers the world over if only it tasted better. There's some nice cherry notes buried in there somewhere, but otherwise the wine is overly tannic and its aromatics seemingly benched.",84,21,California
112730,US,"Lots of acidity gives this Merlot a bite. It's bone dry and pretty thin in fruit, with a modicum of cherry and herb flavors. A solid wine to serve at big parties where no one's very fussy.",84,11,California

112760,US,"Darkly toasted Canadian oak reveals itself through layers of vanilla, smoke and burnt sugar on the nose of this lovely North Fork Cab. On the palate, bright acidity shines through a concentrated black cherry palate flecked with hints of dark caramel and freshly cut mint.",87,28,New York
112770,US,"There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years.",87,90,California
112780,Italy,This well-priced wine opens with defined mineral nuances and segues quickly into blueberries and violets. The mouthfeel is lean and bright and there's a blast of sour cherry on the finish.,87,12,Tuscany
112790,Spain,"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla.

112800,US,"Failla has a great track record with this vineyard, which is source to many wineries. The '06 is fresh and vibrant, and needs a little time to develop. It shows classic balance, with rich tannins, crisp acidity and brilliantly ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola and currants. As delicious as it is now, it's nervous and tentative. Give it a few years to come around.",94,45,California
112810,France,"A wine that shows an airy character. It is very open and fresh, the white fruits floating over a creamy texture and made crisp by grapefruit skin and bitter orange flavors. But it is just beginning to develop its potential, and the wine will likely fill out, as secondary flavors come through over the next 5?? years.",94,,Champagne
112820,US,"Spicy, smoky oak aromas dominate this dark-colored and full-bodied wine. Cherry and raspberry emerge as the flavors. The texture is plush but not quite soft, as firm tannins and moderate acidity give it good structure.",87,11,California

112860,US,"Qupe reaches into the Edna Valley for this finely crafted Grenache. It's pale in color and has the silky texture of Pinot Noir, but there's an earthy, Proven?al herb tug to the cherry and cola flavors.

112870,Italy,"This vintage of Ripasso Ca' del Laito opens with meaty aromas of bresaola and cured beef followed by mature cherry and blackberry. The wine is soft and chewy, with succulent fruit pulp and a distinct note of sweet spice on the close.",87,,Veneto

112890,US,"On entrance, this has forthright flavors of grapefruit, basil and apricot that are highlighted by the well-managed acids. A blend of hybrid grapes—Rayon d'Or, Vidal Blanc and Vignoles—this should pair well with grilled swordfish or seared sea scallops.",86,20,America
112900,US,"At 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.",86,30,New York
112910,France,"It's impressive what a small addition of Sauvignon Gris and Muscadelle can do to a Sauvignon-Sémillon blend—it turns this into an exotic wine, with spice and lychee flavors.",87,22,Southwest France
112920,Argentina,"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",84,25,Mendoza Province

113100,Austria,"Johann Heinrich's vineyards are in the Deutschkreutz region, traditionally regarded as the heartland for Blaufr?nkisch.

The final flavors areof red fruits and lifted acidity. Screwcap.",88,17,Burgenland
113110,US,"This unusual blend of grapes from both Washington and Oregon shows that each state can profit from the other.

113120,Spain,"Familiar berry aromas blend with hard spice notes and a hint of blueberry. Like many 2013s, this is showing a clamped-down mouthfeel along with flavors of peppery black fruits.

114420,US,"From one of Sonoma County's newer mountain appellations, this wine is expressive, with juicy black licorice and blackberry flavors, grippy tannins and a slight reductive note.

114580,US,"This is elaborate, but too soft for a great Napa Cabernet. That absence of structure accentuates its ripeness, giving it tastes of candied cherry and licorice. On the plus side, it's dry and smooth, with lots of smoky new French oak. Drink now.",86,25,California
114590,US,"A big but not-too-tannic Petit Verdot, this is juicy and structured with red fruit and a light layer of spice. Tending toward black licorice and dark chocolate, it could use a splash of something to brighten it up.

114600,US,"As the label says, this is a sweet bubbly, but it's not insipid or cloying. Brisk acidity keeps the raspberry and vanilla flavors clean. Although it's a little scoury, the price is right for a wine that's so deliciously drinkable.",86,13,California

114730,US,"Though this bottling still needs a year or so of patience to truly shine, it's a great example of cool-climate low-alcohol Syrah. Dark in the glass, it shows tar and lavender, but the core is like a black and blue pepper-crusted steak, with charred beef, raw beef and strong spice converging. The palate is all about raw meat, fresh-ground black peppercorn and squeaky tannins.",93,60,California

114750,Australia,"A subtle smoke component adds nuance to the aromas of peach and pineapple. The flavors match up precisely, adding a touch of marshmallow to the mix. This is fairly full bodied, yet lacks a bit of depth and flesh in its midpalate and finishes warm. Drink now.",85,25,South Australia

114810,US,"Tastes young and vigorous and almost rude in youth, offering strong, extracted blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors.

114850,US,"This is a combination of 2003 Petite Sirah, as well as Syrah from both 2001 and 2004. Vineyards from Spring Mountain comprise a majority of the blend. The multi-vintage approach works well, for the wine has the softness and bouquet of an older wine, with the fresh, ripe fruit and acidity of a young one. Raspberries, cherries, blueberries, plums and sweet leather and Asian spices are the main flavors.",91,38,California
114860,Italy,"The blend sees 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero and the wine rests for 36 long months on the lees to produce an extremely creamy and inviting sparkler that is elegant and sophisticated yet genuine at the same time. Yeasty notes of bread crust and apple pie are the most obvious aromas but are soon followed by stone fruit, honey and well-balanced mineral tones.",90,16,Northeastern Italy
114870,US,"Give this Zin extra points for sheer power. The vineyard consists of two parcels in St. Helena that date to the 1930s or earlier.

116500,US,"Soft and gentle, this Mourvèdre, made from old vineyards in the Delta town of Oakley, has generous flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa, violets and pepper. It turns sweet and rich in cassis on the finish.",87,16,California
116510,Italy,"This wine has all the qualities you look for in a good Greco di Tufo: the aromas are fragrant and fruity and there is a solid mineral backbone for structure and dimension. Made from grapes grown in volcanic, sulfur-rich soils, the wine offers pretty tropical fruit flavors.",87,23,Southern Italy
116520,Italy,"Here's a subtle and elegant rosé made with Negroamaro with pretty aromas of raspberry, forest berry and white almond skin. The wine remains in contact with the skins for 18 hours to produce a delicate and fresh companion to Indian or Thai dishes.",86,13,Southern Italy
116530,Italy,"Here's a well-priced Barbaresco from a quality producer with ample oak-driven aromas of almond, spice, milk chocolate and sweet vanilla. It is a genuine and straight forward Nebbiolo with a brambly, thorny finish accented by intense power and loads of black licorice.",90,39,Piedmont
116540,US,"A good followup to the 2004, Ottimino's 2005 is exuberantly rich and forward in jammy wild blackberry and cherry flavors, with an array of spicy pepper, clove and anise. Entirely dry, it's wrapped into ripe, firm tannins. Now through 2010.",90,32,California
116550,Portugal,"Rich and opulent, this is a big fruity, toasty white wine. The vanilla from the wood combines with ripe peach and pineapple flavors, the acidity a hint of tangerine zest. While it is definitely full-bodied, both the full fruit and the acidity give it  very drinkable balance.",89,25,D?o

116580,Italy,"Red currant, blackberry, espresso, wood shavings and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, anise, coffee, coconut and oak alongside alongside drying tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",88,65,Tuscany
116590,US,"A fresh green-apple aroma and vivid citrus and crisp apple flavors are supported by vibrant acidity in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is smooth but crisp, making lots of good food pairings come to mind, from pre-meal cheese, to salads, seafood and veggie pastas.",90,15,California
116600,US,"Aromas of orange blossom and jasmine intoxicate on the entry of this delightful wine, which combines in complex ways to offer savory fennel with a creaminess to the texture. That complexity continues through the finish, which ends long and lean.",90,27,California
116610,US,"This new vintage of Caitlin's Reserve was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It went through regular lees stirring and a generally traditional Burgundian élévage. Trim and compact, it remains up to the taster to forecast how well this will age, and how much complexity is locked within it. Based upon the wine's track record, there's every reason to put away a few bottles to drink in the mid-2020s.",92,45,Oregon
116620,Germany,"Clouds of powdery mineral and pollen blanket dense, ripe peach and apricot in this sprightly, feather-light Riesling. Semidry in style, it bristles with tart tangerine acidity. The finish is long and perfumed in honeysuckle. Drink now through 2025.",92,34,Mosel

116640,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Petit Verdot and Syrah. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, fig, dried fruit and vanilla are reserved while the red- and black-fruit flavors are rich but deft, with the tannins providing some heft. It seems a bit more evolved than its age might suggest.",87,24,Washington

116680,Chile,"Big briary berry aromas smell smoky and like coffee. This is tight at its core, with a sensation of buttery oak around the fringes.

116690,US,"While it shares the same ripe rich fruit intensity of Paumanok's more expensive reds, there's a distinctly green tone to the Festival marked by shades of herb, bramble and green pepper.

116710,Chile,"Melony and sweet smelling, with sticky, strange flavors of chewing gum, melon and pickled citrus rind. Finishes weird, too. Overall, Indomita's wines are outside the lines and hard to enjoy.",82,15,Casablanca Valley
116720,US,"This is a perfect wine, both in accessible flavors and somewhat affordable price, for pizza night or meatballs. Cooked red plum, strawberry and a bit of cracked pepper kick off the nose in the Cabernet Franc-led blend, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. More plum hits the palate along with peppery spices, tobacco and marjoram. It's easy but not overly simple.",89,22,California
116730,US,"This full-bodied wine smells like black currants and blackberries, tastes ripe, and is lightly tannic to give it a little grip. Bring on the beef or pork tenderloin.",89,15,California

116760,US,"Made from 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah this wine opens with a rich mouthfeel and flavors of tobacco and blackberry jam, layers of smoky meat in the foreground. At 15.9% alcohol it devolves into pruny territory, a tad hot on the finish. Drink now.",86,24,California
116770,Chile,"Spicy, peppery cherry and plum aromas precede a medium-bodied palate with grip but not much depth. This tastes warm and spicy, with driving berry flavors. A fresh, lightly woody finish fits the wine.",86,14,Central Valley
116780,Portugal,"A supreme wine that tastes of intense maturity, touched with oxidation. It has gained in color as it ages, so now it is a deep green gold. To taste, it has much of the character of a tawny Port, with smoky old wood flavors. But the perfume, hinting at honey, is of a white Port.",92,,Port
116790,US,"It would be a pity to open this wine anytime before, say, 2010, because it needs age. Now, and for a while, it will taste closed and tannic and raw.

116830,US,"This vintage is the first that was under complete control of winemaker Tyler Thomas, and his studious touch shows magically.

116840,US,"With zero residual sugar, this winning white comes as advertised: dry and delightful in its floral, fresh and fleshy character, vibrantly supported in acidity.

116850,US,"This lovely, memorable wine from a fantastically farmed site is grippy in cherry and pomegranate with a backbone of integrated oak. Crunchy in texture, it shines in floral aromatics and a balanced body weight that's fruity and complex.",94,60,California

116870,US,"Not yielding much now beyond hard tannins and primary fruit flavors of black currants that verge on raisins. But then, it's Petite Sirah, a known ager, and the acid-tannin balance suggests just that. Give it until 2012, at least.",88,24,California
116880,Australia,"Yes, the same Jacob's Creek that turns out vast quantities of drink-me-now wines at sub-$10 price points also makes this age-worthy Cabernet from Coonawarra fruit.

116890,Australia,"Vintage after vintage, this wine impresses for its complexity and balance, and the 2009 won't disappoint on those counts.

Drink it over the next few years.",91,95,Victoria
116900,France,"This rich and integrated wine is full of ripe berry fruit and firm tannins. It is a full, concentrated wine, densely textured and structured. There is a good sense of juiciness behind the youthful, firm surface. Give this fine, great-value wine at least four years.",91,10,Bordeaux

116960,Argentina,"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape.

116970,Italy,"Roscetto, a little-known white grape from central Italy, delivers impressive structure, depth and intensity. As the wine sees four months of oak, this drinks like a red wine. Bright gold in color, this has generous aromas of peach, pineapple, almond, vanilla and spice.",88,,Central Italy
116980,Italy,"Graphite, tobacco, plum, fig and clove aromas come together in the glass. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers mature blackberry, blueberry extract, vanilla and a confectionary note, with the burn of evident alcohol.",86,37,Southern Italy
116990,Canada,"Well along the aging curve, this feels a bit pushed, with divergent and strong flavors of cherry, plum, licorice, smoke and sweet toast. There's a lot going on, though little sense of the elegance that often typifies Pinot Noir, and the tannins have a rough, rustic quality.",86,30,British Columbia
117000,France,"This white blend of Gros Manseng and Petit Courbu, both local grapes for Saint-Mont, produces a ripe, floral wine with touches of honey. It is refreshing as well, with lime juice acidity that sails right through to the end.",86,10,Southwest France

117040,US,"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose.

118730,US,"A beautiful young Cab that continues Salvestrin's unbroken track record of the last several years.

Gorgeous now, and should improve over the next decade.",92,58,California
118740,US,"Floral scents float above a chunky, cherry-fruited, single-vineyard wine.

118770,US,"True to the vintage, this is a rather hard and chewy Cabernet, yet it captures both varietal and vintage character in a style that is ready for that sizzling steak off the grill. Lightly herbal, with black cherry, cassis, coffee and bitter chocolate streaks, it's a firm and well-balanced wine with the potential to age over the next decade or so.",88,22,Washington

118810,Italy,"This blend of 60% Malvasia and 40% Trebbiano boasts caramel, candied ginger and pine nut aromas. The concentrated, polished palate doles out candied apricot, maple syrup and toasted almond flavors, with a touch of carob.",92,50,Tuscany
118820,France,"There almost is the slightest touch of lovely Poire William spirit on the nose. This is a lovely pear-scented, dry wine of immense fruitfulness. A homely earthiness counteracts this and makes for a concentrated, medium-dry but mellow palate. The finish is off dry, lasting and mouthfilling. There is something immensely satisfying about this.",92,29,Alsace
118830,US,"This blend of 48% Counoise, 38% Mourvèdre and 14% Grenache shows gravel, dried cherry, hibiscus and charred wood scents on the lively, fresh nose. Cooked cherry notes are dusted with vanilla and clove on the palate, where tart plum skin flavors the tannic backbone, and a smoky bacon fat finish makes it all the more delicious.",91,40,California
118840,Italy,"Succulent steak or breaded veal would make good pairing partners to this elegant Brunello.

118850,US,"Full bodied and fruity, the 2010 estate Syrah from Va Piano is rounder and less herbal than the 2009. Which style you enjoy is a matter of individual preference.

Lasting but light on the finish. Contains 30% Gracianio, which helps explain the sheer, red-fruit character.",85,19,Northern Spain
118900,US,"An okay wine that's light in color and aromatics, traceable in part to its cooler-climate heritage (95% of the grapes were grown in Mendocino, the rest in Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara), which does give it some subtly pleasing red fruit and spice notes.

118910,Spain,"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.",84,10,Northern Spain

118950,Argentina,"Soapy, floral aromas are more like those of a scented candle than most Malbecs. Next is an astringent, raw palate with sketchy plum flavors and bitterness to the finish. This doesn't taste convincingly natural.",80,12,Mendoza Province
118960,US,"This is a tiny-production blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Cabernet Franc, the latter sourced from Detert East Vineyard along the Oakville bench, the former from Hendry Ranch in western Napa.

A simply gorgeous wine.",95,140,California
118970,US,"This small-production wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

119030,Spain,"Foresty berry aromas are warm and chunky. This feels plump and full in body, with grabby tannins and edgy acidity. Salty spicy plum and berry flavors come with loud oak notes, while this finishes full and stout, with toast and mint-like residuals.",88,20,Northern Spain
119040,France,"Produced by the winemaking team of Ch?teau Giscours in Margaux, this is finely ripe blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. With rich tropical fruits and lime flavors, it is balanced and already delicious. Drink now.",88,18,Bordeaux

119090,Austria,"This is a blend of Weissburgunder and Pinot Blanc that is aged in large barrels on the lees. It has a rich, creamy character with a delicate texture and generous acidity. The palate is apricot flavored but lightly peppery. Full in the mouth, it is ready to drink, but will improve over the next two years.",91,17,Nieder?sterreich
119100,Italy,"Aromas of candied citrus and bell pepper lead the nose. The firm palate offers toasted oak, baked yellow apple, vanilla and lemon drop, with the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit richness.",88,50,Northeastern Italy
119110,Italy,"Floral scents of peach blossom, broom and a whiff of pear mingle in the glass. On the bright palate, toasted almond and aromatic herb give interest to the core of Golden Delicious apple and citrus. It's refreshing and balanced with vibrant acidity.",88,13,Veneto
119120,US,"This wine offers a somewhat uncomfortable mix of herb, vanilla, caramel, green pepper and cherry notes. The mocha-filled flavors are tart, broad and supple, with good acidity and a dry lick of tannins backing it all up.",88,25,Oregon
119130,US,"Char and toast singe ruddy black cherries and plums in this dark, full-bodied Pinot Noir. It's plush and luscious in texture, with brambly notes on the midpalate and fine, slightly bitter tannins lend complexity.",87,20,New York

119160,Spain,"Flat, gritty aromas are a tad volatile. This nonvintage red feels oaky and raw, with prodding acidity. A rough mix of scouring red-berry fruit, briny notes and oak make for a marginal flavor profile, while the finish tastes briny and pickled.",83,15,Northern Spain
119170,Spain,"Yellow in color, with waxy apple and vegetal aromas, this varietal Xarel-lo feels heavy, oily and creamy. Vegetal-leaning flavors suggest canned peas and beans, while a green, oily character persists on the finish.",83,35,Catalonia
119180,Spain,"Stewy and strained on the nose, this Tempranillo feels raw and tannic. Stewy flavors are derivative of the nose, and the wine is rough, hot and severely tannic on the finish.",82,12,Northern Spain
119190,Spain,"With a light tan color and yeasty, briny aromas of vanilla and nectarine, this blend of Macabeo (Viura) and the obscure Merseguera grape delivers a wet, simple palate with citric and malic acid. Pithy citrus flavors of grapefruit and tangerine finish long for a basic, unoaked wine.",84,7,Levante

Best after 2018.",91,50,Washington
119240,US,"This has a very deep color, even for this notoriously dark varietal. Complex aromas blend rich fruit with smoky, peppery notes, followed by mouthcoating flavors like dark-chocolate-covered blackberries.

119250,US,"The seductive, woodsy aroma and complex flavors of tea and cherry are true to the variety.

Very little oak comes through, yet the grapes themselves offer great complexity.",91,47,California

119670,Italy,"New leather, rose, violet, menthol and dark spice aromas set the tone on this luminous red. It's more about finesse than muscle, delivering tight layers of cherry, raspberry, mint and white pepper while tightly-knit refined tannins provide the taut framework.

120840,US,"Cherry cola accents this bright pretty wine. Fruit flavors emphasize fresh raspberries, backed with tangy acidity and modest tannins. Drink now through 2022.",88,22,Oregon
120850,Australia,"This is a fairly big, creamy-textured Chardonnay to consume over the next couple of years. Grilled sweet corn features, but it's backed by ample citrus and peach fruit, and the finish remains crisp and refreshing.",91,24,South Australia
120860,Australia,"Penfolds' Bin 51 is a perennial winner, although the price has been steadily creeping northward. The 2014 is dry and medium-bodied, but fragrant—think flower-shop greens, gingery spice and citrus—and with a welcome bit of texture on the long finish. It should drink well for 10??5 years.",91,40,South Australia
120870,Germany,"Notes of perfume, white peach and honeydew scent this vivacious off-dry Riesling. It's concentrated, with deep, penetrating flavors of lime and pink grapefruit that flood the palate and linger on the finish.",91,23,Mosel
120880,France,"Although it effectively disappeared from Bordeaux after phylloxera, Malbec hung on in Blaye on the north side of the Gironde Estuary. This wine, part of a single-parcel (lieu dit in French) single-varietal range, is richly structured and powerfully dense. It has great tannins and also bold ripe black fruits. Drink this concentrated wine from 2020.",92,40,Bordeaux
120890,Austria,"A touch of honeysuckle works its way through the peachy, lemony nose of this indigenous Austrian. The palate brings out peach and a perfumed, rose-scented phenolic edge. Although the texture is rounded, the palate is fresh and firm. Ripeness and exuberance are coralled into lively and very appetizing freshness.",92,24,Thermenregion
120900,Austria,"Spicy notes of miso and yeast appear first on the nose. The palate, full with vivid spritz, amplifies them even more. Bright lemon notes provide freshness, createing a lively, almost warming but still refreshing Grüner that is all about total savoriness, spice and verve.",92,23,Wachau
120910,Italy,"There's a touch of lemon soda or lollipop at the start that is soon rounded off by fresher aromas of peach and grapefruit. This is a simple, easy-drinking effort.",83,,Northeastern Italy
120920,US,"An acceptable effort, with sour acidity, this Pinot has raspberry and cherry flavors that are marked with a hit of mint.",82,40,California
120930,France,"The perfumes are slightly unbalanced, tasting confected. The fruit seems to be missing.",82,,Alsace
120940,Austria,Ripe yellow pears and blossom honey notes can be teased out of this subtle wine by lots of swirling.The palate tingles with citrus freshness and a phenolic richness that has an intriguing but very pleasant hint of bitterness and some glimpses of star-anise and a lasting finish.,92,52,Wiener Gemischter Satz
120950,US,"Three quarters of this wine was sourced from Taptiel, and 20% from neighboring Artz vineyard, both on Red Mountain. A 5% addition of Petit Verdot came from Dionysus. Heavy and tannic, this is a big-boned muscle wine, with the requisite tannins you'd expect from ripe Red Mountain fruit. Great structure and depth, with lush flavors of cherry tobacco, plum and fig.",92,35,Washington
120960,Italy,"Here's a charming, savory blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino that opens with aromas of red berry, violet and a whiff of sweet cake spice. The bright, juicy palate offers crunchy red berry, cinnamon, anise and orange zest while lithe tannins and fresh acidity offer support. Easy drinking and delicious, it's made for sheer drinking pleasure. Drink through 2018.",90,15,Tuscany
120970,Italy,"This opens with aromas of baked plum, toast, grilled herb and a whiff of espresso. The soft, round palate offers up fleshy black cherry, licorice, mocha and a hint of coconut alongside polished tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the juicy fruit flavors.",90,43,Tuscany
120980,Austria,"Savory yeast notes and white pepper are far more apparent than fruit on this superslender, superpeppery offering. This has zip and liveliness and illustrates perfectly why locals refer to Grüner as Pfefferl, or the little peppery one. This certainly is and provides lots of refreshment and verve.",90,22,Nieder?sterreich
120990,France,"From a beautifully exposed southwest facing vineyard with views of the Pyrenees, this is a serious and impressive wine. There is no holding back on the powerful structure and rich fruit or the dense texture and the layers of spice from the 16 months of wood aging. Balanced and generous, it will age for many years, and will best be drunk from 2022.",96,160,Southwest France
121000,US,"Though an accidental opening in a blind tasting, this wine was stellar a decade old, easily rising above its current counterparts. Extremely complex and savory aromas of au jus sauce, porcini mushrooms, charred beef, black olive, mulberry and hearty black plum give way to a mushroom-laden palate. Black truffle, baked cranberry, underbrush and rugged but refined earthiness shine on the sip.",95,50,California
121010,US,"From a tiny spot near the town of Forestville, this vineyard-designate does justice to the special site, planted in Goldridge dirt to a variety of suitcase clones. Earth, sage and a persistence of exotic spice mark it first, inviting one in for further exploration of raspberry, cherry and a firmness of tannin. Concentrated, it's enjoyable now and yet should have years more to go in the bottle. Drink now through 2024.",94,69,California
121020,Austria,"This is fresh, bright and majoring on slightly stony, flinty lemon notes on a slender body. Drink soon, it will provide ample refreshment.",88,34,Kamptal
121030,Italy,"Compelling scents of acacia flower, beeswax and yellow apple skin waft out of the glass. The vibrant palate offers white peach, pear and a hint of citrus zest alongside crisp acidity that gives this a clean finish.",88,26,Southern Italy
121040,US,"Nuanced rose water, pink grapefruit, ginger and lychee aromas are followed by off-dry fruit flavors and a floral finish. The feel and flavors win you over but the wine wants a little more acid to pull itself together.",88,18,Washington
121050,US,"From cool, coastal sites, this wine impresses in full-bodied layers of lavender, smoke and forest floor, the fruit distinctly plum. Generous tannic structure gives it strength and power that's countered by bright, integrated acidity.",90,30,California
121060,Austria,"An energizing nose combines ivy, lemon, green apple and lime for utter freshness. The palate adds a savory, yeasty note to counterpoint all the lemony freshness. The mix is moreish and lively in this refreshing if light summer wine.",90,16,Kamptal
121070,US,"Grown at the winery's estate vineyard high up in Annapolis, where the ocean looms large, this is a tannic, smoky wine, densely layered in blue and black fruit. Cola, sage and black tea await in the background.",90,35,California

121090,Italy,"Made with certified organically grown grapes, this value blend of Sangiovese (80%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with jammy fruit tones of cherry or blackberry confiture and plush spice and tobacco notes. There's a moist, chewy quality to this wine and a subtle touch of sweetness, too.",87,12,Tuscany
121100,US,"Very young, this is a fine follow-up to the winery's outstanding 2009. Dark and rich, the estate-grown fruit offers far more flavor than almost any domestic Merlot in this price range. Blackberries, black cherry, smoke and espresso lead into a grainy, chocolaty, tannic finish.",87,8,Washington
121110,US,"Pale salmon colored, this medium-sweet blend of Pinot Noir (80%) and Pinot Gris is lightly spritzy with notes of strawberry and mint but doesn't have the acid to hold the sugar up.",84,16,Oregon
121120,US,"An easy, lush Viognier, front-loaded with tropical fruit, lemon, ripe peach, vanilla bean, buttered toast and honeysuckle flavors. Drink up.",84,8,California
121130,US,"Oak dominates this wine, with buttered toast and caramel flavors overwhelming the underlying orange, lemon and peach flavors.",83,28,California
121140,Chile,"Apple and peach aromas struggle to reach the rudimentary level. There's a slight vegetal note to the flavor profile along with sugary melon and pear. This feels flat but not tired, and things taste mildly green and candied on the finish.",83,17,Casablanca Valley
121150,Portugal,"A sweet, fruity and lightly sparkling wine that has attractive acidity to go with its soft red fruits. It makes a delicious apéritif style.",83,,Tejo
121160,US,"Better known for Cabernet, Ballentine brings a deft hand to their Block 9 Zin, which has earned high scores for years. The vineyard is in Calistoga, and the warmth has coaxed out intricate flavors of wild red and black berries and cherries, mocha, herbs and spices, with a distinct black pepper note. The tannins are thick, but very fine. Among the top Napa Zins, this wine will age for a decade or longer.",93,29,California
121170,US,"Surh Luchtel knows how to make a great Cab. The '05 is a beautiful wine, softly complex and layered, with black currant, cherry, mocha, sweet oak and spicy flavors. But it's tannins that really mark this wine. They're so fine, so authoritative. Drink now??010.",92,40,California
121180,US,"Champoux, Charbonneau, Ciel du Cheval, Elephant Mountain, Klipsun, and Slide Mountain vineyards make up this wine. The aromas are lightly styled, with notes of baking spice, caramel, licorice, raspberry and dried herb.

121200,Italy,"Tight and focused, this opens with aromas of wild berry, red rose, culinary spice and a whisper of menthol. Chiseled and austere, the palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a hint of anise. Youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework.

121210,US,"This sweet, red, fortified wine is labeled as a tawny Port but was not made in Portugal, from where the original Port comes. It offers haunting aromas of cherry compote, molasses and cedar, while flavors suggest cherry sauce, caramel and roasted nuts. A mouth-clinging, thick texture extends the finish for minutes.",92,40,California
121220,New Zealand,"This is reasonably firm and muscular for a Marlborough Pinot Noir, yet still retains a welcome sense of elegance. Savory mushroom and meat notes feature prominently, filled out by black cherry shadings and the long, dusty finish. Drink 2018??025.",92,32,Marlborough
121230,Argentina,"Grapy, jammy boysenberry and blueberry aromas are exotic, with integrated barrel and spice notes. This feels weighty but balanced; flavors of blueberry, currant and chocolate finish with plum-like juiciness and length. Drink through 2021.",92,50,Mendoza Province
121240,US,"From a vineyard planted in 1927 and tended to by the producer, this is a bright, lushly crisp wine from a field blend—soft, luxurious and smooth on the palate. The highlights are many, from a seductive leap of raspberry coulis to perfumed lavender and surprisingly nuanced tannins despite the full-bodied ripeness, accentuated by the vintage, and the structured power behind the scenes. Drink now through 2023.",94,47,California
121250,US,"From a historic site planted in 1903, Hayne is perfumed in cherry and raspberry, full-bodied no doubt, yet subtle and nuanced in its plushy complexity and soft structure. Strong on the palate, with a tiny sprinkling of black pepper, it offers length and breadth that suggests further aging. Drink now through 2023.",94,50,California
121260,US,"Though younger than most current Petite Sirah releases, this bottling impresses wildly with fragrant boysenberries and crushed lavender on the nose, proving to be a floral-driven style that's not beaten down by richness or ripeness, despite the higher alcohol level that doesn't show at all. Insane amounts of cracked white and black pepper meet with toasted sesame seeds, tart boysenberries and more lavender on the palate.",93,38,California
121270,Portugal,"Ripe and spicy, this is an obviously wood-aged wine. Spice and toastiness still dominate, although in a few months the potential of the juicy black fruits should become apparent. Wait to drink this wine until 2018.",86,14,Douro
121280,US,"Quite tannic, this hits hard with char, burnt rubber and espresso flavors, some black fruit just showing through. Best to drink up by 2018.",86,27,Oregon
121290,US,"Some aspects of this wine have changed since the 2014 vintage: the alcohol is lower, and the exposure to new French oak (50%) is higher. There's something amiss, however. While light strawberry fruit and hints of chicken stock show on the palate, there's a foreshortening and feeling of dilution on the finish.",86,52,Oregon
121300,Spain,"Straightforward apple and spice aromas draw you in. The palate on this value-priced brut Cava is fresh and focused, with mango, citrus, spice and dried herb flavors. It finishes fresh, with a touch of quince and apple flavor. Good for the price.",87,11,Catalonia
121310,US,"Lots of rich cherry jam, cola, cranberry and mushroom flavors in this dry, tart Pinot Noir. It's a bit brusque in texture, but the spiciness gives it a savory finish. Drink now.",87,55,California
121320,US,"This Syrah is hard and tannic now, and it will always be hard and tannic, but it's quite an impressive wine. So dense and layered, it reveals tiers of complexity with every sip as it airs in the glass. The flavors are of pure, ripe wild blackberries, with currant, coffee and tobacco notes, and sprinkled with crushed black pepper. Drink now??013.",92,69,California

121360,Chile,"Modest red-fruit aromas are edgy, spicy and a touch horsey. Lean and juicy in the mouth, this new Pinot Noir from Santa Ema tastes of plum and herbal raspberry. Dry, spicy and peppery tasting on the finish; true to the variety.",87,17,Leyda Valley
121370,Chile,"Aggressive cherry, plum and cassis aromas come with a hint of rubber. This feels choppy and hard, but lively. Herbal red-plum and currant flavors finish zesty and jagged, but with enough body to handle some inherent roughness.",87,13,Cachapoal Valley
121380,US,"Lemon candy and banana-chip aromas on the nose of this bottling lean into the tropical realm, and yet an orange-juice freshness keeps it light. Flavors of marzipan, bubblegum and banana cream make for a ripe palate, enhanced by a sea-salt richness and a clean finish.",87,14,California
121390,Chile,"Basic apple, melon and bready aromas are fine but not distinct or complex. Ditto the palate, which feels balanced but highly basic. Simple papaya and melon flavors finish flat.",85,10,Maule Valley
121400,Chile,"Gritty citrus aromas are oily but adequate. This basic SB tastes of citrus and green vegetables. Beyond that, it's mostly fresh in feel.",85,10,Central Valley
121410,Chile,Overripe aromas of raisin and prune are matched on a dense raisiny palate that tastes like baked black fruits. The entirety of this wine is raisiny but not unfriendly or difficult.,84,13,Chile
121420,Spain,"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",88,24,Catalonia
121430,Spain,"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple. The finish is quick, ending with a white-pepper flavor.",87,16,Catalonia
121440,Portugal,"This rich wine has 18 months in wood, giving it power and dark tannins. It is concentrated, structured while also elegant. The acidity, the black fruit and the firm texture suggest a wine that could age further and will be better from 2018.",90,32,D?o
121450,Georgia,"Appearing deeply ruby-red to the eye, this semi-sweet wine offers aromas of black cherry, freshly ground black pepper and vanilla bean. There is an interesting touch of coolness amid fruit flavors, especially blueberry and blackberry with notes of custard, caramel and Mediterranean herbs. Smooth tannins and a hint of mint make for a pleasing finish.",90,17,Kakheti
121460,US,"Floral aromas and a bowl full of spiced fruit flavors bring a lot of enjoyment to this rich and generous tasting, full-bodied wine. It has touches of spicy oak, rose petal, citrus and ripe peach.",89,25,California
121470,Spain,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",87,15,Catalonia
121480,US,"A rich, tasty wine, whose berry, cherry, smoked meat, anise, spice and sandalwood flavors are soft and gentle enough to drink now. Combining elegance with rusticity, its varietal blend is mainly Zinfandel, with Merlot and Cab Sauvignon and Franc.",87,48,California

121500,Italy,"Elegantly structured, this offers floral, wild berry and spice aromas. The focused palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, leather, white pepper and licorice flavors presented with laser-like precision.

121510,Italy,"This luminous, garnet-colored wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, earth, toast, red berry and hint of menthol. A framework of refined tannins support juicy red berry, mocha and baking spice flavors. It's already very accessible and should be enjoyed over the next few years. Drink through 2019.",90,90,Piedmont
121520,US,"This medium-bodied wine shows hints of mint and cedar in the aroma, and light cherry and raspberry in the flavor. It's pretty nicely balanced and user friendly.",85,13,California
121530,France,"This wine is all about acidity and citrus fruits. It is too tight and textured to give immediate pleasure and needs to soften. By late 2016, it should fill out and red-fruit flavors will dominate.",85,,Bordeaux
121540,Spain,"Earthy, herbal aromas are heavy and consistent with the winery's other 2011s. A choppy, raw, tannic palate and herbal, saucy berry flavors finish with notes of green herbs, tomato and bell pepper. This has a fine texture, yet the flavors are not ripe or appealing.",85,47,Northern Spain
121550,France,"This impressive wood-aged wine has weight, rich black and red berry flavors and a smooth, unctuous texture. With its concentration, ripeness, acidity and tannins, it could age through 2016.",90,30,Beaujolais
121560,Germany,"Dry, bold and intensely mineral, this powerful Riesling is lifted by whiffs of lemongrass and mint, along with a shining streak of lemon acidity. It finishes with a bristle of lime zest astringency and a hint of white flower.",90,68,Nahe
121570,Portugal,"Pure Touriga Nacional with the grape's characteristic perfumes, this is firm and still dense. Tannins abound along with the blackberry fruit. The aftertaste, with its acidity, promises more aging, so drink from 2018.",89,15,Lisboa

121610,Italy,"This Amarone shows the heat of the vintage. It has black fruit and spice notes but the palate is dominated by searing alcohol sensations. It lacks richness and fresh acidity, and closes on a bitter note.",85,47,Veneto
121620,Spain,"Fruity aromas of nectarine and red plum lead to a citrusy palate with flavors of pink grapefruit and red apple. A chalky, grippy finish is basic in its citrusy, pith-driven character. Drink this refresher as soon as possible.",85,9,Northern Spain

121670,South Africa,"A crisp, minerally wave of apples and pear start this wine from the cool-climate region of Elgin, and on the palate, it's equally delicate. Dry but with a touch of pretty sweetness, the wine is embraceable and a great solo sip.",87,20,Elgin
121680,France,A seven-acre vineyard on the eastern side of Mercurey gives a wine that is broad and ripe. Both its structure and its juicy red fruits are generous and with a firm core of tannins. The wine is likely to age well. Drink from 2022.,93,45,Burgundy
121690,France,"This wood-aged and structured wine is concentrated and dense. It comes from the Premier Cru vineyard just to the west of the village. With generous tannins and juicy ripe red fruits, the wine is broad and going to be rich. Drink from 2023.",93,100,Burgundy
121700,Spain,"Smooth, integrated aromas of cookie dough, forest floor and briary berry fruits lead to a palate that's plump on the edges but more intense and pulling in the middle. Flavors of ripe berry fruits, vanilla and tobacco finish with dry tannins and bold acidity, meaning this has more gas in the tank; drink through 2024.",93,33,Catalonia
121710,US,"This tastes like an orange, peach and guava breakfast fruit drink—sweet and tart in acidity. It has some warmth from the alcohol.",84,16,California
121720,US,"This has slender raspberry and cherry fruit. As a result, the acidity dominates, giving the wine a sour candy tartness. In its favor, it's nicely dry, and it feels silky.",84,25,California
121730,US,"Dark golden in color, this smells sweet—like caramel and toffee—which follows in taste. It's high in alcohol and oak influence.",84,22,California
121740,Spain,"With a pink-meets-tan color and funky aromas of mustard, grass and citrus, this is challenging but ultimately modest. A lean, light body is home to leesy, mustardy flavors of passion fruit and nectarine, while the finish is citrusy but also mildly bitter.",83,16,Northern Spain
121750,Spain,"Almondy in color, with bready, drawn aromas of mustard and pithy citrus, this feels flat and chunky. Flavors of almond skins and pithy white fruits finish with a note of orange peel.",83,21,Catalonia

121770,US,"This is an interesting variety choice for Michigan, yet it seems to show some typicity. Muddled stone fruit meets yellow plum and milky, white flowers on the nose. The palate is focused on citrus and pineapple rind while showing good overall balance of acidity.",86,15,Michigan

121790,France,"Ripe aromas of peach, melon, apple and pineapple unfold on the nose of this wine, with additional hints of hay and flint that add an earthy streak. The light-weight palate shows a soft prickle of acidity that then fades quickly on the finish, feeling a touch flat. Drink now.",86,18,Languedoc-Roussillon
121800,US,"Too big by far for a Pinot Noir, this single-vineyard bottling is heavy-handed. It has caramelized cherry and blackberry fruit flavors and a soft, candied quality. Ultimately, it lacks the elegance and delicacy of a fine wine.",84,48,California
121810,Spain,"Ripe cassis and berry aromas come with common Rioja side notes of vanilla, cedar and tobacco. This wine feels flush, with plenty of weight but also balance.

121820,US,"This wine is tight as a drum at present. Brooding aromas of iron, black cherry, pomegranate, bacon fat, spice and cured meat lead to concentrated full superpolished dark-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of intensity and deliciousness that is impossible to ignore.",92,44,Washington
121830,Austria,"Both the juicy and the tart notes of ripe apple and freshly cut apple peel play on the nose. The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous. The finish is delicate and the wine seems just off dry, although it is a proper late-harvest style. It would be an absolute winner with soft cheeses.",92,20,Burgenland

121860,Spain,"Soft and stewy up front, without a whole lot of vigor. It feels wide and hard, with abrasive tannins and strained flavors of herbal berry and leather. On the finish it's earthy, tannic and warm, with a weedy note along with barrel spice.",83,15,Northern Spain
121870,Argentina,"This is hard coated with a creamy plastic note and a milk chocolate scent. Overall it smells heavily oaked and artificial. It feels resiny, with sticky tannins and thickness, tasting of hickory and carob.",81,15,Mendoza Province
121880,Spain,"Berry and plum aromas come with hints of smoke and asphalt. The very high acidity creates a shearing mouthfeel, and the flavors never evolve past tart red plum and cranberry.",80,9,Central Spain
121890,US,"A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now??021.",96,85,California
121900,US,"Here's a smooth, creamy Chardonnay for drinking now. It has good weight, with a deep center of citrus, peach and buttered toast flavors. Russian River Valley acidity makes it racy and clean.",88,35,California

121930,Spain,"If time waits for no one, don't wait for this. A blocky, jumbled nose of charred and baked black fruits is rustic and off-base. Clove, all-spice and other savory flavors dominate a heavy, unbalanced finish.",81,35,Levante
121940,US,"This is a stellar representation of the region, combining ripeness with dark earth and wild herb notes. Aromas of black cherry, crushed slate, turned loam, dried hibiscus and violets make for a lavish nose. The rounded palate weaves black raspberry together with gravel, thyme and sagebrush. Iron fist, silk glove, utterly delicious.",96,60,California
121950,US,"A full array of chaparral aromas arise prominently on this bottling, with thyme and sagebrush spicing up the smoke, earth, crushed slate and dark-cherry scents.

Quite a full experience.",95,46,California
121960,Italy,"This savory selection offers earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle and leather. The zesty palate expresses tart red cherry flavor punctuated by mint, vanilla and espresso accents.

121980,Argentina,"Was probably better a year or two ago; now it's losing steam and smelling and tasting oily and pithy. Aromas of almond skins denote old age, and while there's still vital acidity and leftover citrus flavors, it's fast approaching its deadline. Best to wait for the 2010, or even the 2011.",83,15,Mendoza Province
121990,Italy,"Scents of chamomile, tropical fruit and citrus zest lead the nose on this vibrant blend of Friulano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon.

122030,US,"This is an awesome Cabernet, that's so packed with blackberries and cassis, it blows your mind. The richness is superbly balanced by fine acidity and sweet, complex tannins that rein everything into a focused structure. Feels velvety, refined and ageable. Hold until 2018 and drink it for an additional decade or beyond.",95,100,California
122040,US,"So soft and dense in richness, this is easy to enjoy now. But you really want to restrain that impulse and give it some time in the cellar. Blended from roughly equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's dry and tannic, but with a molten core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise and sweet new oak. Very fine, very elaborate and complex. Give it 5?? years, at least. This wine could still be unfolding in 2020.",94,125,California

122060,Italy,"A blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this robust red opens with aromas of ripe, black-skinned fruit, cedar and ground pepper. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries and black currants accented by licorice and allspice. Velvety tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. It will definitely appeal to fans of bold, muscular wines, but it's shy on freshness so drink now.",90,115,Tuscany

After baking spices, mellow fruit comes through on the palate, while the firm texture really keeps it going on the finish.",92,26,California
122090,US,"This wine is more structured, tannic and textural than many, and shows the sophisticated personality of a dry wine that still has plenty of ripe flavors. It smells and tastes like wild blackberries dusted with cinnamon. Drink now through 2020.",92,50,California

122200,Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness.

Drink now??015.",89,15,Cauquenes Valley

Drink after 2022.",97,98,Piedmont
122430,Australia,"These blends are traditional in Australia—they're just rarely this good. The 26% Cabernet gives great backbone and a sense of restraint to the wine, which might otherwise seem overdone or sloppy.

122500,Austria,An appetizing top note of candied lemon peel hovers over the glass before spicy hints of pear peel become apparent. The palate is edged with very precise zesty grapefruit hints that frame and corset a most generously white-pepper-spiced host of pear and yellow plum fruit. It is the structure of that zesty acidity that make this luminous and appetizing. This is rich but concentrated; delicious now but built to last. Drink 2017??035.,95,48,Wachau
122510,Italy,"Inviting aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, new leather, pressed blue flower, mint, cake spice and a balsamic note meld together on this delicious, impressive red.

122530,Italy,"Thanks to the super tight and astringent tannins that are present in the Sagrantino grape, you'll want to pair this Umbrian red with succulent steak or a thick slab of aged pecorino.

122540,US,"A welcome addition to the Bunchgrass lineup, this white Bordeaux-style blend is one third barrel-fermented Semillon, two thirds tank-fermented Sauvignon Blanc.

122550,Chile,"This is classic Chilean Cabernet. It's intense in color, with herb, graphite, licorice and blackberry aromas.

A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length.",95,30,Washington
122580,US,"Almost as perfect a Stags Leap Cabernet as you can find, showing lush, opulent and immediately appealing flavors. Blackberries, plums, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet oak combine in a spicy swirl. The tannins are fiercely soft, an oxymoron that suggests the wine's complexity.

122730,US,"This bottling, which is already good but shows potential to be great, eschews overly obvious fruit aromas to instead deliver notes of peppercorns, pencil shavings and green bell pepper.

123020,New Zealand,"On the nose, this shows some of the Awatere Valley's classic nettle or tomato leaf-like signature, but also hints of stone fruit and struck flint. On the palate, it nicely combines elements of stone fruit, citrus and fresh herbs, finishing gentle and easy.",90,30,Awatere Valley
123030,New Zealand,"The Palliser Pinot style is typically a bit beefy, and this 2013 follows suit. That said, it's likely to age well—at least through 2020. Cherry, herb and mocha aromas and flavors finish with a slightly dusty texture and firm acids.",90,35,Martinborough
123040,France,"This is fully mature with its leather and toast flavors enhanced by a smooth, rich texture. It is a delicious wine to drink now, with some red fruits and final acidity.",88,25,Bordeaux
123050,US,"Meaty, dusty aromas of leather, cigar box, old books, roasted lamb, tobacco smoke and purple flowers make for a compelling nose on this wine. The palate is quite leathery, with beef crust, wood smoke and incense ash flavors, delivered in a smooth manner.",88,20,California
123060,US,"The volatiles are amped up on this wine along with aromas of fruit leather and cherry cough drops. It's full bodied with firm, chewy tannins that need time to soften.",88,80,Washington
123070,Italy,"With fruit harvested from the beautiful Brunate cru located just a short distance away from the Barolo castle, this wine from Marcarini will delight you. The aromas here are full, generous and recall wild berry, cedar, smoke, licorice and cherry cola. Tight, firm tannins and bright acidity make the wine both cellar worthy and food friendly.",93,58,Piedmont
123080,US,"Massive. Made from 100% Cabernet, and lavish in new French oak, it's an impressive wine, but not one you want to open now. Everything is on steroids, with a heart of blackberries and currants just waiting to emerge. Cellar through 2011 and try again.",93,65,California
123090,Australia,"Aged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023.",92,70,South Australia
123100,Portugal,"Full of red fruits and generous tannins, this is an immediately attractive wine. The red-berry fruits are balanced by good acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017 to allow the tannins to soften further.",88,25,Douro
123110,US,"An action-packed wine, especially considering the price, this is a lighter, fresher style of Zin, with smashed strawberry and boysenberry fruit aromas alongside chipped asphalt and riverstone. Juicy olallieberry and baked cherry show on the sip that is enhanced by a touch of oregano.",88,16,California
123120,Portugal,"This wine is ripe and fruity, layered with attractive tannins and red-berry fruits. It is bright, crisp at the edges although also with a smoky, firm core. Drink this wine from 2020.",88,17,Douro
123130,Australia,"The Ratbag makes for a pleasant, if somewhat generic dry red. Dried fruit and prune notes are complemented by chocolate overtones and the mouthfeel is soft and user-friendly.",84,18,South Australia
123140,Portugal,"A tight, freshly acid wine, with stalkiness but also good juicy fruit. There is a green pepper element, leaving a wine that is light, simple.",84,8,Bairrada
123150,Chile,"Dark, fruity and common in every way, but sometimes that's all you need. The wine has a clean, ordinary cassis and berry nose followed by a juicy palate with dark fruit flavors that show accents of vanilla, spice and chocolate. Totally drinkable and likable.",87,8,Lontué Valley
123160,US,"A little sharp in acidity and jammy, with cherry, wintergreen and cola flavors. Nice and dry, with a rich coat of sweet smoky oak, but that sharpness persists through the finish.",87,40,California
123170,Italy,"Blangé is a supremely clean and pristine white wine to drink as an aperitivo or with fresh salads or seafood. There are bright fruit notes here of peach, pear and citrus but there's also a very attractive mineral tone that holds it all together. The wine is fresh, crisp and tonic throughout.",87,27,Piedmont
123180,Spain,"Ripe berry aromas are tinged with rubbery, gaseous notes on this Tempranillo blend. The palate is chunky, blocky and low on acid, which results in a jammy wine with a hint of saltiness on the back palate. Clove flavors define the finish.",85,,Northern Spain
123190,Italy,"This pretty rosso has typical fragrances of dark fruit and spice. The palate shows ripe plum and cherry layered with cinnamon notes. It's fresh and ready to enjoy now, and would pair well with pasta dishes or grilled chicken.",85,11,Tuscany
123200,US,"A strong, oaky Chardonnay. Lacks subtlety and interest, but if you're looking for sheer power, it's for you. Shows pineapple jam, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",86,45,California
123210,US,"From the heart of the Napa Valley, this estate white is dry in floral lemon and lime, in addition to more voluptuous helpings of apricot and peach. Stainless-steel fermented, it offers crisp acidity before taking on complexity on the finish, more weighty than on the palate.",90,24,California
123220,US,"The appellation continues to impress with this variety, well showcased by this producer. White flowers and waxy apple form its character foremost, followed by lemon peel and zest. A dry, salty finish makes for a conclusively satisfying end.",90,14,California
123230,Austria,"Concentrated grapefruit zestiness dominates the palate while the nose remains rather closed. This is streamlined, refreshing and firmly located in the green citrus spectrum of flavor—eminently refreshing with a clean, brisk finish.",90,29,Nieder?sterreich
123240,US,"Flirts with Portiness, but stops just short to provide a rich, exotic Zinfandel experience. The blackberry, currant, wild mountain berry, cola, tangerine zest and pepper flavors have an edge of raisins. Creative cooks will use the above descriptors as a recipe for a salsa to top a perfectly grilled burger or steak.",90,32,California
123250,Australia,"Impressive for its balance of soft, creamy richness with bright, juicy raspberries. Notes of brown sugar, cinnamon and espresso add a layer of decadence surprising at this price.",90,17,South Australia
123260,US,"Too oaky, with toothpicky vanilla and caramel flavors swamping the underlying fruit. Too bad, because the basic wine is nice and crisp in pineapples.",85,28,California
123270,Italy,"You can't beat the sense of history awarded by this tangy, crisp Falanghina. Fruit is farmed near the ancient city of Pompeii under the menacing shadow of Mt. Vesuvius. The result is a sharp, tonic wine with kiwi, lime and grapefruit aromas.",85,15,Southern Italy
123280,France,"Tangy and mineral, this is a crisp apple- and citrus-driven wine, full of fruitiness while also having a tight texture. Its acidity just adds to the generally ripe character of the wine. Drink now.",87,37,Burgundy
123290,US,"Fresh, forward and fruity, this brings light strawberry fruit and streaks of root beer. It's tasty and quaffable, though done in a lighter style.",87,25,Oregon
123300,US,"Sandalwood and a shovelful of fresh earth mark the entry of this wine aromatically. A soft, tart expression of the variety, it offers bittersweet tannin and dark cherry at its core.",87,52,California
123310,France,"Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. It has forward succulent strawberry flavors that are gently lifted by acidity. There is also a young, almost bitter character that, unusually, suggests this rosé needs to age. Drink summer 2016.",86,,Loire Valley
123320,US,"Though shy on the nose, this popular bottling delivers intrigue on the palate. Light red-cherry flavors are bolstered by pepper spice and a chalky tannic grip. Even for geeky connoisseurs, it's a good bottle for later in the night.",86,,California
123330,US,"Subtle green-apple aromas and rich, ripe pear flavors make a pretty convincing argument for this full-bodied but soft-textured wine.",86,15,California
123340,US,"A tasty Sauvignon Blanc, with crisply acidic grapefruit, pineapple and lime juice flavors, touched with oak. A nice appetizer sipper, with some complexity. Good with asparagus risotto, bruschetta with goat cheese, a nice roast chicken with sautéed new potatoes and rosemary.",88,25,California
123350,Portugal,"Broad, ripe style, concentrated while retaining lightness of touch. There is a good mineral element balancing the yellow fruits and rich texture.",88,,Douro
123360,France,"Without any dosage, this bone-dry wine has shocking initial acidity that then opens up to allow the attractive white fruits and mineral character to shine. It is six years old, but it still tastes young and should be kept until 2017.",89,,Champagne
123370,Austria,"Very juicy, easy blueberry-fruited, light Zweigelt made for fun, easy drinking. Unpretentious and honest, this could also be chilled in summer. Wonderful for picnics and other occasions where a joyful but uncomplicated red is needed.",89,18,Burgenland
123380,France,"This is a rich, densely tannic wine with dark-hued blackberry fruits and ripe acidity. It is concentrated, still very firm while just beginning to show its full-bodied character. Wait until 2018.",89,38,Bordeaux
123390,Spain,"Peach and apple aromas are soft and easy, maybe even a touch cidery. Overall, this is a standard but well-made Albari?o, with flavors of nectarine and cider. Drink immediately.",88,17,Galicia
123400,US,"This is an appealing, dry, and well-balanced wine, with everything in good proportions. It has lots of fresh cherry aromas, good and deep fruit flavors and a light but tasty layer of toasted, smoky oak.",88,10,California
123410,US,"More assertive and full-bodied than many versions, this wine smells like snap peas and spring flowers, but gets richer on the palate as peach flavors come out and mingle nicely in the unusually rich texture.",88,18,California
123420,US,"This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.",87,15,California
123430,Spain,"Strawberry and other red-fruit aromas run the bouquet. The palate is tangy and crisp, with dry but clean red-fruit flavors. Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.",87,12,Northern Spain
123440,US,"A little on the sweet side, but crisp acidity provides a clean whisk of tartness, and the lemon-cream and orange flavors are absolutely delicious.",87,15,California
123450,US,"A dry, thin, modest Cabernet, the kind you drink in a paper cup at big parties. The host serves it, and you drink with the food.",82,9,California
123460,Argentina,"Sweaty and feral smelling, with just a tad of the pleasant lychee and melon this grape is known for. Feels heavy and oily, with barely any acidity and pithy, oily, citrus flavors. Clunky stuff for new Torrontés.",81,12,Mendoza Province
123470,US,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish.",91,15,Washington
123480,US,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",91,32,Washington
123490,US,"Malbec is likely to become a signature red for àMaurice, as for a number of other young Walla Walla wineries. This excellent bottle proves the point. It's fragrant and deep in color, with verve, tangy blackberry and currant fruit, polished slightly grainy tannins and a seductive, mouth-coating finish. Just the right touch of earth, herb and licorice to give it added interest through the finish.",91,34,Washington
123500,US,"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish.",86,23,California
123510,Portugal,"Coming from the north-eastern Beiras region, close to the Douro, this wine is a ripe, rich and crisp wine. It has a perfumed character from the Malvasia in the blend and an attractive yeasty aftertaste. Drink now.",86,27,Távora-Varosa
123520,Italy,"The nose on this isn't very expressive but eventually reveals notes of red berry, baking spice and a whiff of grilled herb. The palate is raw and tannic, offering unripe sour cherry, young sage and ground pepper but it lacks fruit richness. Bracing tannins dry out the mouth.",86,,Piedmont
123530,Chile,"Not all that clean or clear up front, with aromas of sweated onion and field greens. The palate is fairly sharp and tangy, with pickled flavors of sour apple and lemon. Citrusy on the finish.",82,11,Casablanca Valley
123540,Chile,Less adequate than in the past. The wine lacks aromatic zest and pungency before showing tart apple and ultimately vegetal flavors. Canned pea notes are prevalent.,80,8,Central Valley
123550,Italy,"White cherry, raspberry, almond skin and cola describe the simple bouquet of this easy-going red. On the palate, it's crisp and lean.",84,14,Veneto
123560,US,"The basic Chardonnay here is nice, with citrus, pear and pineapple fruit flavors. But the oak weighs heavily, bringing a caramelized, butterscotch candy sweetness. Lots of people will like it for exactly that reason.",83,18,California
123570,US,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot, this feels a little light on flesh, providing little cushion to the high acids. A campfire smokiness underscores the rusty dark-fruit note, which ultimately finishes a bit short.",83,,Michigan
123580,France,"Smooth and round, this wine is made from grapes that were sourced from the southernmost vineyards of the C?te d'Or. It has a soft, rich and fruity character that shows citrus and white peach flavors, plus a pineapple hint. As it opens, it becomes opulent and full bodied.",91,60,Burgundy
123590,US,"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this is a blend of three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Each new vintage seems to bring a bit more depth to the wine, and the flavors of berry and plum remain fresh, with a gentle kiss of new oak.",91,55,Washington
123600,Italy,"This Acciderba shows elegance and intensity, and it offers notes of oak-derived spice, dried herb, blackberry and clove. On the palate, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese delivers firm tannins and tangy barbecue and teriyaki notes.",91,42,Tuscany
123610,US,"This is a sleek and easy-to-appreciate Pinot Noir, on the lighter side, with fresh cherry and raspberry flavors, a touch of acidity for balance and a gentle texture. It seems polished and complete and not overdone.",89,50,California
123620,Germany,"Aromas of crushed stones and smoke lend a dusty mineral tone to this steely, savory-style Riesling. It's dry on the palate, yet refreshingly lean with a kick of lemon-lime acidity that reverberates through the finish. A surprisingly elegant wine at a bargain price.",89,12,Pfalz
123630,France,"This is a gloriously juicy wine, full of melon, apricot and the brightest citrus flavors. This fruit salad is given structure by the wood and the tangy, zesty edge. It drinks well now, still young and fresh, but will be better aged. Drink from 2016.",89,37,Burgundy
123640,Spain,"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth.",87,12,Catalonia
123650,Spain,"Earthy aromas of saline, minerals and iodine dominate herbal fruit notes. This has a tomatoey, high-acid feel and rubbery tannins, while flavors of salty, briny red plum and currant finish similarly. A good mouthfeel is the highlight on this briny Monastrell.",84,9,Levante
123660,Spain,"Pungent, feline aromas of green citrus and passion fruit filter into a citric, pulpy palate. Flavors of mixed citrus fruits, green herbs, onion and passion fruit finish heavy, with a lingering note of pickle brine.",84,13,Northern Spain
123670,Portugal,"Off dry, fizzy and fresh, this is a classic crisp and clean Vinho Verde, based on the Loureiro grape. It is light and bright with lemon and sugar water flavors, and is ready to drink now.",84,10,Vinho Verde
123680,US,"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",90,14,California
123690,US,"Exotic in orange blossom and jasmine scents, this wine presents as full bodied, brawny and rich, showing a touch of oak reduction on the palate. Within that framework, hints of lemon and grapefruit keep it feeling fresh.",90,25,California
123700,Australia,"The Hilltops is a high-altitude (approximately 450 meters above sea level), continental region that's often a good source for value. This wine is crisp, youthful and firm, with hints of baking spices and vanilla accenting pure cassis fruit. Drink 2020??030.",90,15,New South Wales
123710,France,"This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The fruit is dominated by the high toast flavors needing time to integrate into the blueberry fruit flavor. That will happen, allowing this crisp, balanced wine to shine. Drink from 2020.",89,40,Burgundy
123720,Italy,"Inviting aromas of violet and ripe red-skinned berry take center stage in this wine. The lively, full-bodied palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors framed by velvety tannins and zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2020.",89,22,Piedmont
123730,France,The wine comes from a new appellation at the southern end of the C?te de Beaune. It is a blend of different premier cru vineyards to give a juicy raspberry flavored. Tannins show a solid dry background to the attractive perfumed fruitiness. Drink from 2019.,89,,Burgundy
123740,Spain,"This standard Garnacha is good and honest on the nose, with fresh red-berry aromas. In the mouth, it's snappy and kind of lean, with a lightweight composition and zesty flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's quick to finish, with a note of vanilla.",86,12,Northern Spain
123750,US,"Notes of strawberry and red cherry surface on the nose, followed by touches of beeswax, dill and exotic spice. This is a medium-bodied wine with enough tannins to lend structural support. The finish bears delicate cinnamon and herbal-tea flavors that linger with some astringency.",86,22,Virginia
123760,US,"Sourced from the vineyard's original 1970 planting, this is a succulent, dense, captivating wine. Scents of pollen, honey, tea and apricot lead into a mouthful of similar flavors. The tastes of apricot jam show tremendous concentration and length. It's a gorgeous effort that should continue to age and evolve now through at least 2030.",94,30,Oregon
123770,US,"Wichmann is the smallest of the estate vineyards and holds the oldest vines. That old-vine intensity rings true here, in a low-alcohol wine with splendid aromatics. Musk, chocolate, almond candy and caramel swirls around black raspberry and black cherry fruit. The depth of flavor is striking.",94,49,Oregon
123780,Portugal,"Unusual for Vinho Verde, this wine was aged in wood for nine months, resulting in a rich, full-bodied character. It's ripe, full of yellow fruits and crisp pear flavors, shot through with lemon acidity. What it potentially lacks in freshness it makes up for in intensity and depth of flavor. Drink from 2016.",93,,Vinho Verde
123790,France,"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years.",92,75,Burgundy
123800,Italy,"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon shows remarkable richness and smoothness. It delivers bright, fresh tones of black cherry and blackberry that are backed by touches of leather and tobacco. It's velvety and taut, not too heavy or extracted.",92,,Tuscany
123810,Portugal,"Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon merge seamlessly in this richly structured but fruity wine. It is densely concentrated, with a line of tannins cutting through the blackberry fruit flavors. Firm, textured and likely to age well, this is impressive.",92,15,Tejo
123820,US,"This blend of 66% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 6% Viognier shows even more Roussanne character than the pioneering winery's single variety Roussanne. Honey, marcona almond, praline and lemon curd aromas lead to a grippy palate full of judiciously presented vanilla, marzipan, and mango flavors, with a beeswax note on the finish.",91,20,California
123830,Italy,"Aromas of black-skinned berry, tilled soil and new leather lead the way. The full-bodied concentrated palate delivers black cherry, tobacco, licorice and a note of black pepper framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018??025.",91,90,Tuscany
123840,US,"This Sierra Foothills-based winery makes a compelling if atypical Sangiovese that offers black cherry, soy, crushed rock and rose petal scents. Upright tannins present strawberry, black plum and loamy soil flavors, finishing on a sweet-savory hoisin sauce note.",91,28,California
123850,US,"Sourced from vines approaching 30 years of age, this is quite dry and complex, with plenty of dry extract. Scented with citrus and stone fruits, flavors run more toward apple and pear. The length is impressive.",89,20,Oregon
123860,US,"This dry white wine seems to be all about smooth texture and reserved flavors rather than overt fruitiness. It has a gold, Chardonnay-like color, mild aromas of almond and butter, a rather full body and a lingering but subtle honey-like finish.",89,28,California
123870,Italy,"The nose is initially closed but opens to reveal rose petal, red berry and white pepper aromas. The warm, forward palate offers dense black cherry, espresso and alpine herbs alongside a solid tannic backbone.",89,93,Piedmont
123880,France,"One of a range of top cuvées from this cooperative in the grand cru village of Mailly, this is a Pinot Noir-dominated wine, fashionably pale in color with a good balance between crisp red fruits and tight, nervy acidity. A touch of tannin gives structure to this elegant wine. Drink now.",91,122,Champagne
123890,US,"This shows dense notes of plum and cedar, with firm, sizable tannin. The body and ripeness mark the vintage but find balance within a structure of subtle oak. Enjoy best from 2021 through 2023.",91,75,California
123900,France,"As befits a 100% Pinot Noir wine, this is a rich Champagne, poised between ripe apricot and pear fruits and more mineral acidity. Just a touch of tannin adds structure to this ready-to-drink wine.",91,45,Champagne
123910,New Zealand,"Although only medium in body, this comes across as slightly heavy. Ripe flavors of nectarine, pineapple and mixed citrus are attractive, but lack refreshing zip on the finish.",85,17,Marlborough
123920,France,"This is a caramel-flavored blend of Merlot, Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Malbec. That's a range, but the result is an attractive fruity and soft wine. It is bright at the end with plenty of acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",85,12,Southwest France
123930,France,"This is a soft pretty wine with a light fruity character. It is gently fruity, finishing with a peppery edge and crisp acidity. Drink now.",84,10,Provence
123940,France,The second wine of Cos d'Estournel is powerfully packed with tannins and dark ripe fruit. It is enormously rich and intense while keeping a fine smooth texture. There is a dark core that is going to allow the wine to develop over many years. Drink from 2024.,93,65,Bordeaux
123950,Italy,"This opens with inviting, classic Sangiovese aromas: woodland berry, forest floor, new leather, violet and truffle. The youthfully taut palate isn't quite as expressive—yet—but already offers Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise notes. It's primary in its flavors now but will develop complexity over the next decade and then maintain well for years. Drink 2022??032.",93,40,Tuscany
123960,Australia,"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now??025.",93,185,South Australia
123970,France,"A ripe and fruity wine that has rich tannins and a soft, full structure. It has jammy black currant fruit flavors that are already developing well with spice from wood aging. There is a dry core that, with the acidity, will allow the wine to age well. Drink from 2015.",89,,Bordeaux
123980,Portugal,"A wood-aged white that is gently spicy, while also ripe and fruity. It has great balance, with its rounded character cut by delicious citrus and peach flavors. It will certainly age, so drink from 2015.",89,,Douro

124030,France,"This sweet rosé is light, with some attractive ripe strawberry flavors. Grapefruit acidity gives it a fresher side, lifting the bright, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",83,15,Loire Valley
124040,France,"High levels of acidity give this wine a tight, eye-watering character. The fruit was probably not ripe.",82,15,Bordeaux
124050,France,This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels.,82,14,Bordeaux
124060,US,"A first for the winery, the vinification layered whole clusters with destemmed grapes. Not too much—just enough to stiffen the tannins a bit. Scents of rose petals and cherries lead into black-cherry fruit, all laid upon a carpet of roasted nuts. The supporting acids carry a hint of orange peel. This is an all-around delightful bottle.",92,45,Oregon
124070,Spain,"Aromas of spiced cherry and cassis are schisty and belie this Cabernet-heavy wine's age. A narrow palate with firm tannins and not much give sets up flavors of oak, lemon peel, plum and berry fruits. A lasting finish with deep berry flavors and a topping of oak doesn't lose steam. Drink through 2025.",92,44,Catalonia
124080,US,"This wine is a new addition to the lineup. It opens with aromas of herbs, dark chocolate, barrel spices and dark fruit followed by a fresh lively palate loaded with dark-fruit flavors, fresh acidity and fine grained tannins, with the finish lingering.",92,60,Washington
124090,US,"Here's your basic white Zin, fruity and slightly sweet, with jammy raspberry and vanilla flavors. Crisp acidity fortunately provides needed balance.",83,9,California
124100,Argentina,"Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors. Finishes a bit edgy and candied, and overall it's generic with little personality.",83,9,Mendoza Province
124110,US,"A gorgeous wine, the best Big River that Ravenswood has ever produced. Has everything you want in a Zinfandel. It displays rich, peppery blackberry and currant fruit, splendid tannins, crisp acidity, fine dryness and a long, impressive finish. The high alcohol is not out of place.",92,35,California
124120,US,"A complete and expressive wine, with vibrant berry/cherry fruit, supple textures and a gentle hand with the oak. The tannins have been well managed and mediated; the wine is tannic but smooth with no roughness or excessively green flavors. It captures just a hint of pepper and herb, and is streaked with coffee highlights through the finish.",91,40,Washington

The long finish of yeasty spicy savor shows off the serious core of this wine.",94,54,Kamptal
124200,Austria,"This is still tightly closed: There are merely some notions of iron oxide on the nose, but otherwise this is brooding and mysterious. The palate, however, has something majestic and sumptuous about it—a warm heart of ripe and aromatic black and red cherry. This just needs to breathe and will unfurl like crimson velvet on your tongue. While this can be approached now as it is beginning to mellow, this will be even better in the years leading up to 2020. Very moreish.",94,50,Burgenland

With a pinch of oak, this wine more than makes the grade.",89,20,Casablanca Valley
124960,US,"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine.

126310,Australia,"Scents of wet stone, paraffin and citrus ease into flavors of lemon, melon and tea on the palate. This is light in body and silky in feel, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink it now or age it up to 10 years, maybe even longer.",92,24,New South Wales
126320,US,"This is a 100% varietal, vineyard-designated wine, impressive in its ability to provide lush richness within a balanced context. Dark and thick, it opens with blackberry, mocha and spicy clove flavors. Although syrupy, it maintains freshness on the palate.",92,125,California
126330,Portugal,"This is an off-dry, crisp and fruity wine with lively acidity and an attractive prickle on the tongue. It's a bright wine, as light and bright as possible with citrus flavors bursting from the glass. Drink now.",87,12,Vinho Verde
126340,US,"This value-priced low-alcohol wine has all the refreshing elements for a good rosé: light body, mild watermelon and peach flavors and a crisp texture. It has fresh acidity and good balance, too.",87,25,California
126350,France,"This Merlot-dominated blend is full of dense fruit, with a soft black currant flavor. A bite of tannin at the back gives structure and aging potential. Drink from 2019.",87,24,Bordeaux
126360,US,"A very nice Pinot that shows the classic elegance associated with this producer. It's one to drink now. Dry and silky, it offers rich, complex flavors of cherries, cola, spices and sandalwood. Feels really classy all the way through.",90,36,California
126370,US,"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.",91,20,California
126380,France,"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging.",91,18,Southwest France
126390,US,"Good as this wine is, it's very rustic nature. The tannins are hard and brittle, the acidity is high, and the wine veers between leaner tobacco notes and superripe currants. But its heart is pure cherry. Will age forever, without gaining complexity, so enjoy it now with your favorite pasta and tomato sauce, and plenty of grated cheese.",86,38,California
126400,US,The oak is at the fore here with notes of pine and wood spice along with blue berry. The concentration is good but the tannins seem a bit dry and the alcohol lingers.,86,25,Washington
126410,Chile,"No two ways about it: this Syrah smells, tastes and finishes with stewy tomato notes and earthy, fruity flavors. The palate feels full but sort of flat, while the flavor profile consists of earthy, stewy berry flavors that veer toward wan and overripe. Prune and earth notes define the finish.",86,30,Leyda Valley
126420,Greece,"Spicy black pepper, smoke and crushed herb aromas give this red an exotic feel. On the palate, lush red berry flavors mingle with herbs, pepper and vanilla spice. A distinctive wine and a great partner to dried meats, olives and ripe cheeses.",88,35,Pangeon
126430,Italy,"Mature blackberry, cherry and oak sensations are in the forefront of this Montepulciano and Sangiovese blend. The palate delivers ripe fruit along with espresso, mocha, licorice and spice, alongside firm tannins.",88,29,Central Italy
126440,US,"Sourced from the Kiona vineyard on Red Mountain, and vinified in Oregon, this features a brambly, berry-strewn mid-palate with dried leaves and spices adding further interest. It rolls pleasantly across the palate into a tart, fruity finish.",88,30,Washington
126450,US,"Light, clear and softly crafted to highlight dried herb and cranberry tea, this is a rounded, approachably complex wine, a nice representative of the vintage, warm and easy. Peppery cola closes things out with length and grace.",93,60,California
126460,Italy,"Initially closed, this eventually offers alluring aromas of toasted hazelnut, exotic spice, steeped plum and nutmeg. The chewy palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, baking spice, vanilla and a hint of coffee alongside velvety tannins that lend polished support and a smooth mouthfeel. Drink through 2023.",93,38,Piedmont
126470,Argentina,"Dark, lightly toasted aromas of licorice root, coconut, blackberry and peppery spice are inviting.

Drink now through 2021.",93,99,Mendoza Province

126500,France,"For a simple Beaujolais, this has richness and fruit density. It's as fruity as the wine should be, but it also has firm tannins. The finish has a minerally texture along with black-currant-like acidity.",86,25,Beaujolais
126510,US,"A tremendous wine, satisfying in youth, but this should also age for a while. Made with just 2% Merlot, it's impressive in young Cabernet blackberry and cassis flavors, liberally oaked and sweetly pure in the finish. The tannins are so soft, yet so refined. Should develop through the decade, but if you drink it now, give it a good decant.",92,60,California
126520,US,"Soft, slightly hot and peppery in alcohol, but very dry, this Merlot shows intense flavors of cherry marmalade, blackberry essence, dark chocolate and cedar. It's a rich wine to drink with grilled steak. The tannins will balance out the meaty richness.",92,60,California
126530,New Zealand,"Consulting winemaker Jenny Dobson—who crafted some remarkable wines at Te Awa from 1998??008—has turned out a remarkably tannic yet balanced wine from Murdoch's Gimblett Gravels vineyard. Cracked pepper, cedar and cherries finish firm and dusty in this young wine that's built to age. Drink 2019??030.",91,37,Hawke's Bay
126540,US,"This wine is half Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of baking spice, herb, dark chocolate and dark cherry are followed by luscious ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's irresistible in its appeal.",91,20,Washington
126550,France,"Produced in the typical flinty (silex) soil of parts of Sancerre, this wine has a crisp steely texture that is balanced by the ripe yellow fruit. The combination is both taut and ripe, giving good balance and tension. Drink this wine from 2017 to allow it to develop further.",91,29,Loire Valley
126560,Canada,"Rich and concentrated, this uber-reserve offers well-defined pear and lemon curd flavors, within a fresh pastry setting. The length and creamy texture is impressive. Drink now through 2020.",91,50,British Columbia
126570,US,"Fresh aromas of blueberry brioche and blackberry jam on toast meet with a touch of baking spice, lavender, and crushed gravel on the nose of this 61% Syrah and 39% Grenache blend. The palate is more tightly honed, with dried violets, dried blueberry and a strong black-pepper character.",91,60,California
126580,US,"While exuberantly fruity, almost tropical on the nose, there's a crystalline edge to this dry Riesling that renders it especially refreshing. It's vibrant and light footed, brightened by a lingering honey note on the finish.",90,25,New York
126590,France,"This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink.",88,25,Loire Valley
126600,Italy,"Aromas of red berry, sunbaked earth and crushed blue flower lead the nose. The easy-drinking palate offers mature wild cherry, white pepper and anise alongside polished tannins. It's simple but savory. Drink through 2016.",88,15,Tuscany
126610,France,"The texture and structure of this wine may be light but the fruitiness is so appealing. Soft and ripe with red-berry fruit flavors and refreshing acidity, it will develop quickly and be ready to drink from 2017.",88,49,Burgundy
126620,South Africa,"Bright, lively notes of yellow peach, apricot and melon adorn the bouquet of this attractive white, while hints of spiced orange, ginger and fresh herbs mingle in the background. It's medium weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and final touches of rosewater and sweet spice that grace the finish. Drink now.",89,22,Wellington

126660,US,"In warmer years this vineyard, in the far western part of Paso Robles, can produce splendid Pinot Noir. But 2011 was shockingly cold, and this wine suffered as a result. It has tart acidity and vegetal, mushroomy notes that the toasty oak can't cover.",84,40,California
126670,Argentina,"Gritty aromas of severely baked berry fruits are tough to plow through. In the mouth, this Malbec is jammy, chunky and a touch flat. Flavors of stewed berries and prune finish thick and taste cooked. Ready to drink now.",84,27,Mendoza Province
126680,US,"Good everyday Pinot. It's a bit rough in texture and thin in fruit, but gets the job done. Shows cherry, currant and cola flavors, boosted by bright Carneros acidity. Drink now.",85,40,California
126690,US,"Full-bodied and heavy in the Loring style, an extracted wine filled with exciting fruit and berry flavors, but lacking the delicacy and finesse you expect from Pinot Noir.",85,50,California
126700,Argentina,"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",85,12,Mendoza Province
126710,US,"Nice structure on this dry, smooth Cab, which is made in the modern cult style of soft, immediate likeability. The blackberry, cassis, cherry and oak flavors are appealing. But at this price, you have a right to demand more depth and complexity.",86,33,California
126720,South Africa,"An enticing nose of buttery oak and flavors of toast, minerality and yeast makes this ample-bodied sparkler an impressive solo sip or great when paired with richer foods like oysters or cream-based dishes. Creamy on the tongue and full of flavor, the wine is classic in style and well priced. Imported by GBW, LLC.",86,22,Robertson
126730,Israel,"Although this wine is currently a bit firm and closed, it has the stuffing for great evolution and shows promise for a long future. Dark, ripe raspberry and strawberry fruit characters are laced with touches of Asian spice, reduced balsamic and wild game. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts chewy tannins that persist long into the finish. Drink 2014??018.",90,50,Galilee
126740,Italy,"An organic blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers enormous richness and concentration. The wine is soft and lush, and it exudes dark fruit flavors that are backed by touches of mineral and smoke.",90,48,Tuscany
126750,US,"This Chardonnay has ripe, rich tangerine, pear and pineapple flavors. It wasn't aged in oak, and the malolactic fermentation was blocked. The result is a clean, vibrant and mouthwatering selection.",90,34,California
126760,France,"This estate wine of Belcier is rich and complex. It has great tannins as well as dark black fruits that give a ripe character. Juicy, fruity and still young, it has great potential. Drink from 2018.",91,,Bordeaux
126770,Spain,"Blackberry, dark plum, mineral, char and leather aromas are what you want from a quality wine from Ribera del Duero. A layered, fresh palate houses lightly brined plum, black cherry and leathery flavors. A toasty finish with licorice notes hums along in fine form. Drink through 2021.",91,25,Northern Spain
126780,US,"This is a vibrantly energetic wine, explosive in raspberry and cherry, with a weedy, herbal undertone that gives it intrigue. Concentrated on the midpalate, with well-ingrained tannins, it finishes in a highlight of toasted oak.",90,32,California
126790,US,"The 2008 Sineann Pinots are an elegant, refined group of wines, more expressive of Burgundian varietal character than any in memory, and the Resonance, as usual, is among the best. It has a vibrant purity to the fruit that rings true and long through mixed red berries, vivid acids, streaks of iron and earth, and sails on into a detailed and seamless finish.",92,48,Oregon
126800,US,"A wonderfully rewarding wine. It shows the dryness and crisp acidity you want in a savory white, and the fruit flavors, of peaches, grapefruits and green apples, are controlled and subtle. There's just a touch of oak, which adds softness, and of creamy lees. Brilliant and distinctive. Albari?o and Grenache Blanc.",92,20,California
126810,France,"Solid and structured, this shows the firm side of Fleurie. It is dominated by tannins that overlay the red berry fruit and the firm plum-skin texture. With its weight and concentration, this needs to age for another 2?? years.",90,23,Beaujolais
126820,Chile,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes with a deep, minerally aroma as well as with lush black-fruit, herb and spice notes. The feel is plump and smooth, while the core flavors are of blackberry, tobacco, raw oak and spice. It's predominantly round and ripe, but there's more than enough crispness and tannic bite to keep things framed.",90,19,Colchagua Valley
126830,US,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Brut X designation refers to the winery's driest sparkler, but the wine retains plenty of sweet, ripe strawberries, raspberries, limes, vanilla and honey. It's very good, but a minor critique is a certain roughness of texture. Drink now.",88,50,California
126840,US,"Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, and aged for two years in French oak, this ripe, juicy wine is filled with flavor. Blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, cola and sweet toast fill the mouth. The tannins are substantial, but nothing that barbecue can't deal with.",88,52,California
126850,Argentina,"Big, smoky dark-berry aromas come with no small amount of graphite, pencil eraser and baked notes. This feels chewy and earthy, while roasted flavors of smoked meats, blackberry and molasses finish jammy, with brown sugar accents.",88,18,Other
126860,France,This is a tight wine with acidity and a good future of crispness. Give this attractive wine a few months and its citrus fruit will show well. Drink from late 2017.,84,15,Bordeaux
126870,Portugal,"This is a blend of Alvarinho and Loureiro, two of the most emblematic grapes of the Vinho Verde region. The wine is crisp, attractively fruity and light and poised. Drink now.",84,12,Vinho Verde
126880,US,"This wine is reduced and somewhat flat in tone, with simple, light-bodied ripeness and plum and raspberry flavors.",84,25,California
126890,Argentina,"A fruity, jammy style of Cab with thick berry aromas resting in front of a full-bodied, chewy palate with forward red berry and chocolate flavors. This is smooth, not complex and easygoing proof that Argentina is not only about Malbec.",87,14,Mendoza Province
126900,US,"Lots of berry, cherry and currant fruit in this dry Cabernet, which is drinking nice and mellow. It could be more concentrated, as it falls off in the finish, turning bitter.",86,35,California
126910,Portugal,"On the stalky side, this is all red berry fruits, with just a touch of wood to underpin the wine's fruit-forward character. Screwcap.",86,9,Tejo
126920,US,"Honeyed layers of yellow peach and tangerine seem to be dusted by bramble and mineral tones in this semisweet Riesling. It's a spry, zesty wine with a lip-smacking, juicy finish. Drink now through 2019.",87,15,New York
126930,Italy,"Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.",87,40,Tuscany
126940,Turkey,"A nose of raspberry, brambles and confectioner's sugar gives way to flavors of strawberry, peach, menthol and eucalyptus. A fairly stiff tannic structure and tart, slightly green notes keep this wine from fully coming together on the palate.",87,16,Turkey
126950,US,"The Naked (organically grown) series from Snoqualmie continues to expand, now with this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It feels soft and manipulated in the mouth; there is a hole in it. Despite the black cherry and smoke flavors, it feels insubstantial and incomplete.",84,12,Washington
126960,Chile,"A very dry, crisp white wine with a neutral color and equally neutral aromas and flavors. It's lean, green apple-driven and fresh, but not what you'd call loaded with personality. Cleanses the palate and washes things down, but does so quietly.",84,12,Elqui Valley
126970,Italy,"Here's a fresh, simple Barbera with a tiny touch of toasted almond that gives it slightly more complexity and intensity. The mouthfeel is lean and light with a short but satisfying finish.",87,35,Piedmont
126980,Chile,"Light and airy, with red fruit and tea aromas. The palate is fairly acidic but not harsh or sour; flavors of pie cherry are balanced and sweetened by caramel, yet the finish is lean and quick, with citrus peel and zest. More of a lighter-bodied refresher with just a spot of oak.",86,13,Casablanca Valley
126990,Portugal,"One of a series of four wines featuring the major red grapes of the D?o, this wine concentrates on the least familiar. The Jaen gives a tight, structured wine that is still firm after six years. Blackberry fruits and spice fill out the dry core and leave an impressive wine that is likely to live long. Drink now.",93,32,D?o
127000,Portugal,"The red-juice grape Alicante Bouschet gives a fine performance here. It has produced a firm, structured wine with fine tannins as well as generous black fruit. It comes from a hot year in the region, producing great ripe, sweet fruit as well as intense acidity. The wine is just now ready to drink and will still mature further, at least until 2022.",93,50,Península de Setúbal
127010,Australia,"Sourced from the Tarraford Vineyard (better known for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir) this is a floral, aromatic wine. Notes of green peppercorns and pipe tobacco ease into raspberry fruit, made more complex through whole-bunch fermentation. The wine's silky texture is an added treat. This has the potential to be really interesting as it evolves through at least 2025.",93,60,Victoria
127020,US,"Fruit-juice-like aromas of quince, pear and apricot lead onto the weighty palate. It tastes slightly off dry and succulent, and it deals bold flavors and juicy acids.",84,19,Virginia
127030,South Africa,"Light and approachable, this offers friendly aromas and flavors of grass, pear, gooseberry and lemon-lime acidity, ending short and crisp. Drink up.",84,14,Stellenbosch
127040,New Zealand,"Crisp and dry, this is a medium-bodied, slightly austere wine. Hints of smoke or stuck flint join with grapefruit rind on the nose, while a slightly bitter note appears on the palate and persists through the finish.",84,15,Marlborough
127050,Portugal,"The Vital grape in the blend gives crisp acidity to this soft wine. Light and lively, it's packed with fruit and has a bright aftertaste. Drink now.",85,11,Tejo
127060,France,"Touches of vanilla and spice give this wine an attractive character. Its light, tangy texture adds crispness that supplements the bright acidity. Drink now.",85,15,France Other
127070,US,"This wine is smooth and densely packed in earth and blackberry, the overall tone voluptuously concentrated and full bodied, with a tenacious embrace of ripeness.",85,34,California
127080,US,"As always, this single-vineyard Syrah is a masterful mix of tart fruit, herb, stem and earth flavors. Pomegranate and red currant, umami and gunflint highlights are all in focus.",92,50,Washington
127090,Italy,"Concentrated sensations of apple, pear, lemon, mint and mineral are accented with rosemary, sage and intense smoky notes. It's structured but elegant with a great depth of flavors. This is already delicious but will develop more complexity. Drink now through 2020.",92,38,Southern Italy
127100,US,"Mainly Cabernet, it shows the variety's hard tannins and and black currant and dark chocolate flavors, but 21% Cabernet Franc adds easier notes of sweet cherry jam. Still, it's pretty tannic, and suggests aging until 2021??022.",92,90,California
127110,US,"The vibrant, opaque purple color of this wine attests to its good concentration. The nose shows attractive notes of cherry cola while flavors on the palate are disappointingly diffuse, reminiscent of a red berry soup. The soft, sweetish palate with velvety tannins finishes a bit short.",83,38,New Mexico
127120,Australia,"Classic Chardonnay aromas of apple, pear and hay lead into a palate marked by decent intensity but also a bit of sweetness. Orange and candy notes run through the rather short finish.",83,10,Australia Other
127130,US,"A very light shade of pink, this wine is quite delicate, maybe too much so, showing light strawberry, bubblegum, nectarine and tangerine-peel notes on the nose. The palate offers a lot of texture but not a ton of flavor, with raspberry and dried-lemon elements.",86,23,California
127140,France,"The traditional aging on the lees has given this wine its rich floral character. It is a ripe wine, with apple fruit and a smooth, creamy texture. The wine is ready to drink.",86,11,Loire Valley
127150,US,"Quite yellow in color, this wine opts for a deeper rather than fresher style of the grape, offering aromas of iodine, orange extract and concentrated apples. The palate presents dried-apple flavors.",86,25,California
127160,US,"This Syrah is just too high in alcohol. Nearing 16% abv, it's as hot as a chili pepper. Some wines can handle that. As it's slender in flavor, it can't handle the heat. The addition of some Monterey County fruit adds acidity and freshness.",82,29,California
127170,US,"This is lightly oaked, with pleasant Chardonnay flavors of oranges, limes and mangoes. However, it's too sweet, with a sugary finish that makes it cloying.",82,8,California
127180,Chile,"Simple white-fruit aromas of apple and pear are as good as it gets. Feels slightly wan, with apple and green-herb flavors, finishing a bit bland.",82,10,Maule Valley
127190,US,"Though it's barrel fermented, this is a thin, hard-edged wine with green and slightly stemmy flavors only partially masked by the buttery barrel notes.",83,12,Oregon
127200,US,"Chewy, earthy and tannic, this rather awkward wine matches cranberry and black cherry hard candy fruit to a rough, stemmy underbelly. There is some leather and barnyard in the middle; all in all it's a bit of a rough ride.",82,24,Oregon
127210,Germany,"Light as a feather yet bold in fruit, this sprightly sp?tlese packs a punch of sweet, ripe apricot, peach and even raspberry flavors. Spine tingling grapefruit acidity lends vitality, guiding a breathlessly perfumed, floral finish. It's a thrilling, irresistible wine.",94,40,Rheingau
127220,US,"Dusty gravel and chalky rock mark the texture and nose of this 100% varietal wine, a sense of minerality that's uniquely its own. Currant, cranberry and an herbaceous streak define the midpalate, flavors that ride a lightly bodied, silky-smooth wave of nuance and elegance.",94,150,California
127230,US,"This wine is a blend of 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc. It brings heady aromas of blackberry, black cherry, earth, herb and coffee followed by dense palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. The hedonism is dialed up and the finish won't quit. The balance is absolutely impeccable. Best from 2022 to 2030.",94,75,Washington
127240,US,"Aromas of freshly cut green pepper, herbs, cherry and dark chocolate pop on this lightly colored wine. It's high octane with lighter-styled cherry flavors.",87,15,Washington
127250,Spain,"Rubber, iodine and a heavy dosage of oak char create a smoky but one-dimensional bouquet. This is round and full in the mouth, with jammy black-plum and berry flavors that ultimately get overshadowed by char and bitter chocolate notes. Lasting barrel influence makes for a toasty, blackened finish.",87,30,Galicia
127260,Spain,"This is a touch stalky and leathery up front, with animal and wild berry scents. Choppy acidity makes for a perky mouthfeel, while rustic, leathery flavors of baked plum finish earthy, oaky and a touch salty.",87,11,Levante
127270,France,"This is Montaudon's prestige cuvée, a wine with bottle age and elegance. A strongly toasty, yeasty character gives secondary flavors to the ripe fruits. It is textured and complex, a serious wine that has been given just the right amount of aging. Drink now.",92,60,Champagne
127280,South Africa,"This blend of 48% Merlot, 35% Malbec and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon is plush and accessible, with attractively ripe notes of brambly blackberry, raspberry and cherry on the nose and palate. Soft, spicy tannins lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture, while hints of licorice, vanilla bean, fruitcake spice and black tea add depth to the medium-weight mouthfeel and linger long through the finish. Drinkable now, but should hold well through 2020.",92,79,Paarl
127290,US,"More dry-farmed wizardry from this reliable producer, this blend of 61% Tannat, 15% Zinfandel, 14% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon shows violet, tobacco, beef char and dried purple flowers on the nose. The palate offers asphalt, rosemary-crusted lamb and complex gamy flavors.",92,60,California
127300,Argentina,"Intense, focused and also quite floral on the nose, this blend of Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and the Italian variety Ancellotta is all about the fruit. Flavors of fig, blackberry and cassis ride nicely on a smooth, chewy palate. On the finish, this is layered, deep in feel and toasty in flavor. Drink this impressive, full-bodied blend now through 2018.",92,38,Mendoza Province
127310,Italy,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this structured wine opens with an intense fragrance of violets, iris, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The concentrated palate delivers layers of rich, wild cherry, mocha, white pepper and clove alongside bracing but fine tannins. This needs time to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2015??025.",92,68,Tuscany
127320,France,"Fruity notions of apple juice and fresh apple peel are signalled on the nose. The palate follows more softly than expected and shows a balanced, textured dryness in this very clean, almost taut Riesling.",88,18,Alsace
127330,France,"Very ripe pear fruit is dangerously close to tipping over into cloying richness, almost hinting at cream soda. The palate is less overwhelming. As always, that special streak of Alsace acid saves the day.",88,19,Alsace
127340,US,"Equal parts Viognier and Roussanne, this offers aromas of ripe peach and flowers that lead to dry, full-bodied flavors that taper toward the finish.",88,20,Washington

127360,France,"An attractively ripe and dry rosé, balancing crisp orange zest with raspberry and a delicious streak of acidity. There is a touch of bitter lemon for a final lift.",88,52,Provence
127370,US,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6?? years.",97,75,California
127380,US,"Dainty aromas of fresh apple and freesia are juxtaposed gorgeously against a striking tinge of petrol. While initially soft and honeyed, Sheldrake's Dry Riesling is remarkably lean with a steely minerality and focused, lime-inflected acidity.",88,15,New York
127390,US,"A beautiful wine, sharp and clean in acidity and savory, with ripe lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit citrus flavors. Finishes dry and honeyed, a paradox.",88,15,California
127400,US,"Envy has a very consistent track record with this bottling. The 2011 is typical of the house style, off-dry and honeyed, with pleasant citrus and grass flavors that veer into riper tropical fruits.",88,25,California
127410,US,"Made in a more popular style than Calera's Mt. Harlan bottling, this Chard features lush flavors of pineapple and orange jam, honey and vanilla. The acidity is bright and mouthwatering.",88,18,California
127420,US,"Rich, ripe and extracted with cherry and currant fruit, this Cab Franc shows fine tannins, acids and a dry finish that makes it drinkable now. It has a Napa fanciness that lifts it into elegance.",88,50,California
127430,US,"The winery's seldom-made reserve, this is a blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Syrah. Among a stellar group of 2009 J. Bookwalter reds, this is the toughest to decipher—at least at first. It shows good balance, a forward, fruity start, and then a descent into very dark, very toasty barrel flavors.",93,80,Washington
127440,US,"This is so succulent you'll want to finish the entire bottle with a great steak or chop. It explodes in the mouth with a sunburst of cherries and raspberries, spiced with cinnamon, smoky oak and orange zest. This is one of Handley's best in years.",93,52,California
127450,US,"This is marked by intense flavors of blackberry, cherry and currant, with sweet smoky oak, firm, furry tannins and brisk acidity. All of these elements jostle for position, making the wine currently aggressive and unresolved. However, the suggestion of ageability is warranted. Put it to sleep in your cellar for six years and see how it's doing. It could be fine in 2020.",93,95,California
127460,US,"Easygoing oak wraps around tart acidity in this simply conceived, straightforward and easy-to-like white. It's light bodied and crisp, with green apple and Meyer lemon flavors.",88,20,California
127470,France,"This is not nearly as rich and plush as La Nerthe's luxury-level Cuvée des Cadettes, but remains a very good wine. Red plum and red currant fruit is medium-bodied, supported by bright acids, while some slightly ashy notes and a hint of cocoa emerge on the crisp finish.",88,65,Rh?ne Valley
127480,US,"This twist-top take on a red Italian table wine is perfect for pizza, pasta or hamburgers, with black plum, cola and pressed purple flower aromas. Olallieberry, plum and licorice flavors show on the quite-dry palate, making it a solid weekday wine.",88,20,California
127490,Chile,"Aromas of pineapple, lemon and stone fruits lead into a palate that is ripe and round, with apple butter and pear flavors. The finish is dry and fairly simple, with banana-like richness and tropical fruit notes, but also some late bitterness. Just two things hold it back: The texture is a bit flat, and the acidity could use a jolt.",85,10,Colchagua Valley
127500,Chile,"Bright violet in color and well extracted, but also vegetal. You'd think from the hue and vintage that it would be seamlessly ripe, but it seems green at the core. Thus while it delivers texture, rich plum fruit and tannic structure, there's a gap in  clarity of fruit flavor.",85,12,Rapel Valley
127510,Chile,"Cranberry and raspberry comprise the red-fruit nose, and next is the aroma of horse hide and a heavy dose of oak. The fruity palate is all about plum and cassis, and on the finish everything is in place and the texture is firm.",85,7,Rapel Valley
127520,US,"This combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 11% Cabernet Franc, the trio integrating perfectly, with density and tannic grip. Oaky vanilla notes enwrap jammy blackberry, clove and a dark chocolate flavors, its juiciness lingering long into the finish.",90,90,California
127530,US,"Lightly floral, this wine offers a medium-bodied wealth of stone fruit and pear, remaining fresh and lively on the finish despite ample succulence.",90,45,California
127540,US,"This wine has a classic personality: round and soft in tannin, with a chalkiness lurking behind herbal tobacco leaf, tomato, cedar and rose notes. Full-bodied, it doesn't hold back on ripeness but displays more savory character than fruit.",90,155,California
127550,US,"Stella Maris is priced well below the other Northstar wines, but can stand on its own with this kind of quality. Bursting with tangy berries and lively acidity, it feels sculpted and refreshing, deep and lingering. A lick of mocha and a finishing hint of licorice add to the pleasure.",91,29,Washington
127560,US,"A sharp, spicy, beautifully-defined example of Washington Syrah. Purple berry fruits, lingering, focused, and intense. Tasted right at release, it is still sharp and woody, and very much in need of more bottle age. But the basic juice is exemplary, and the finish has a pretty, toasty ring to it.",91,38,Washington
127570,US,"This Bordeaux blend is solidly in the Darby style, but bigger and fuller and rounder than the other wines, with lovely, plummy aromas that lead into mouth-filling blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit. The use of 75% new oak is not intrusive; it's truly just an accent, and does not overtake the fruit.",91,50,Washington
127580,US,"An amazingly rich, complex and ageworthy wine. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar. Best 2012??018.",95,100,California
127590,US,"From a warm appellation, a rugged, earthy wine with some distinctly raisiny notes. It's very soft and round, with a low-acid, velvety mouthfeel and outsized fruit. The finish is a bit sweet and Port-like.",83,20,California
127600,Australia,"Good party Chard. Nothing too complex or subtle, just mixed tropical fruit with a hint of wood and sweet fruit-cocktail flavors.",83,6,Australia Other
127610,Argentina,"Given this Chandon-owned winery's success with Malbec, you might hope for more here. But this fading Chardonnay doesn't have much going for it. It's flat, with pleasant clove-like aromas and cider-like flavors. It also finishes flat, indicating a short lifespan ahead of it.",83,8,Mendoza Province
127620,US,"This light copper-colored, bright-tasting and dry wine made from Tannat grapes smells like watermelon and peaches, tastes fresh and lively and has a tangy texture. It was made in a serious style that will taste great with grilled seafood, gazpacho or tuna tartare.",90,24,California
127630,France,"Ripe and juicy, this dense wine offers red-fruit flavors shot through with acidity. The old vines give depth to the rich wine that finishes with layers of bright fruit. Drink from 2018.",90,55,Burgundy
127640,US,"Soft and gentle in handfuls of rose petal and cardamom, this wine veers more savory than fruity, offering definite appeal to fans of a full-bodied yet more complex style. That exotic spiciness persists to the finish that adds length and breadth to the acidity.",90,50,California
127650,France,"This is a concentrated wine that is structured and packed with red fruits and solid tannins. It feels weighty and rich; the juicy character is balanced by a firm, dry texture. For aging over several years.",90,25,Bordeaux
127660,Italy,"This is a crisp expression of Nebbiolo that is finessed and elegant. It opens with dusty aromas of dried currant, crushed stone and black pepper. The tannins are solid and polished; it needs at least 10 more years of cellar aging.",90,58,Piedmont
127670,US,"Blended from Mendocino, Clarksburg (Delta) and Pope Valley fruit, this easy-drinking Cab is very ripe in blackberries and cherries, but also shows a good structure of tannins and acids. The alcohol is refreshingly low. A good price for a wine so satisfying.",87,14,California
127680,France,"This is an attractive, relatively light Sauternes. It has a fine botrytis character that's already well integrated with the orange peel and honey flavors. Not for aging; ready to drink.",87,37,Bordeaux
127690,US,"A great value Cabernet that's earthy and direct, this has just enough flavors of red and black cherry and tobacco, with soft tannins that keep the wine interesting through the long, slightly spicy finish. There are handfuls of estate-grown Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec in the mix. Pair it with hamburgers.",87,15,California
127700,US,"Young and snappy with crisp green apple fruit flavors, this racy and nicely textured Pinot Gris shows excellent balance, concentration and length. Delicious now and should improve through 2017.",89,16,Oregon
127710,France,"Dominated by Merlot at 90%, this is a smooth, rich and generous wine. It does have a tannic core, but that is surrounded by these velvet, ripe berry fruits and opulent texture. The wine is developing well and should be drunk from 2016.",89,55,Bordeaux
127720,Italy,"It opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia flower and lightly toasted oak. The smooth, structured palate offers lemon drop, white peach, papaya and a subtle note of vanilla and spice.",89,30,Lombardy
127730,France,"Ripe strawberries and crisp acidity blend together in this refreshing, crisp and fruity wine. Produced from Cabernet Franc, the wine is lightly perfumed and with a final shot of bright acidity. Drink now.",88,19,Loire Valley
127740,Italy,"Pretty aromas of violet, red berry and crushed herb lead the way. The bright, accessible palate offers pomegranate, sour cherry and white pepper flavors within a frame of solid tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink through 2023.",88,42,Piedmont
127750,Argentina,"Oaky aromas of mocha and spice blend with racier scents of tomato and red plum. This Malbec feels full in body but sinewy and tough. Flavors of spiced tomato, herbs and salty berry fruits are savory. It finishes with toasty, peppery flavors and choppy tannins.",88,25,Mendoza Province
127760,US,"This is generous and juicy, with lush and very ripe flavors of apples and stone fruits, really loaded with fruit flavors and plenty of tangy acid. The midpalate hangs sensuously, loaded with sweet orange and Meyer lemon; this is the sort of rich, ripe, fruit-powered yet still racy Riesling that Washington makes better than anywhere in the world.",91,16,Washington
127770,Italy,"This seductive Brunello portrays aromas of black fruit, vanilla, brown sugar, plums and prunes wrapped within a thin veil of smoke. It's a wine that reaches a comfortable level of intensity and balance and that offers mouth-puckering flavors of sour cherry on the finish.",91,60,Tuscany
127780,Chile,"Morandé's top Chardonnay is a single-vineyard offering from the oldest vineyard in Casablanca Valley, and is aged in French oak. Hearty buttery aromas give way to some mineral and banana notes underneath; toasty apple flavors in a rich, full mouthfeel are thankfully devoid of cloying creaminess. Oak is good, but still overshadows the fruit.",86,15,Casablanca Valley
127790,US,"If one word could sum up this wine it would be “safe.??It's a Sauvignon Blanc that tastes like Sauvignon Blanc, but avoids any aggressive vegetal notes. Gooseberry and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, with a slight creaminess to the texture, make it easy to drink.",86,18,California
127800,Italy,"Bright and intense berry aromas lead into a tart palate that runs heavy with pie cherry and leather. It's probably a tad too tight, tart and hard to merit higher, but with food it should do the trick. Some dark black coffee notes on the finish add to the wine's drying character.",85,18,Tuscany
127810,France,"From the small Champagne region around Sézanne, this is a rounded, mouthfilling Chardonnay. It has ripe citrus and orange fruit flavors with a touch of apricot. It's a classic apéritif style.",89,43,Champagne
127820,US,"High-toned aromas  of cherry and red plum entice on this surprisingly robust Finger Lakes Pinot Noir. Concentrated flavors of cherry and wild strawberry are brambly and tart, with shades of granite that linger elegantly on the palate.",89,47,New York
127830,US,"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors. Aromatic lavender and jasmine notes against a backdrop of meaty tobacco make the presence of Mourvedre apparent.",89,30,California
127840,Spain,"Firm cherry and berry aromas offer grit and a whiff of asphalt on the side. A grabby palate is driven by a slightly astringent acid-tannin package, while flavors of roasted berry fruits are round, dark and toasty. This is a touch edgy but tasty and good.",87,15,Central Spain
127850,France,"Toasty aromas go through to the palate, highlighting the wood aging. It is tense, mineral, packed with apple and lemon acidity. The aftertaste is equally crisp and bright.",87,23,Burgundy
127860,Spain,"Berry, mild prune, licorice, herb and rubbery aromas set up a wiry mouthfeel that's full of energy. Lemony oak rests on top of earthy berry fruit flavors and hard tannins, while oak and high acidity as well as plum and raspberry notes finish it off.",87,18,Northern Spain
127870,US,"Minty, with a strong menthol character, this wine is high in acidity and overtly earthy. It offers a smoky after-note of leather and clove.",87,60,California
127880,US,"A blend of Merlot and Syrah, the aromas of smoke, matchstick, high-toned dried herb, spice and purple fruit give way to quite sweet-seeming dark-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The sweetness seems distracting.",87,14,Washington
127890,US,"A brilliant shade of purplish-pink, this bottling is quite light on the nose, with hints of hibiscus and raspberry. The flavors are crisp and easy, with tart strawberry, light nectarine and subtle cranberry juice.",87,26,California
127900,Italy,"Charred earth, underbrush, cured meat and toasted hazelnut aromas lift out of the glass. The robust palate is almost overripe, offering dried black cherry, grilled sage, tobacco and a hint of game alongside tightly packed tannins that clench the finish. Drink 2019??025.",89,65,Tuscany
127910,France,"Bringing together fruit from the different soils of Pouilly Fumé, this rich wine offers pear and apricot flavors as well as a strong citrus element. It also is a smoky, steely wine with a firm texture that underlies the fruit. Drink from 2017.",89,52,Loire Valley
127920,Italy,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, espresso, baked plum and grilled porcini lead the nose. The tight, taut palate delivers fleshy Morello cherry, blackberry clove and licorice while close-grained tannins leave an assertive, tongue drying finish.",89,62,Tuscany
127930,Chile,"A bit on the heavy and stewed side, but good in terms of fruit content. The feel is rich, rubbery and tannic, while the flavors run toward medicinal, syrupy berry fruit and then a warm, lightly baked sweetness on the finish. Ripe and rugged Chilean Cabernet.",86,17,Maipo Valley
127940,France,"Crisp grapefruit and citrus character, with tight lime zest acidity. While the wine is full in the mouth, it has the brightest acidity, pear juice and a final pepper burst.",86,12,Loire Valley
127950,Greece,"Cinnamon, vanilla, coffee and red berries on the nose are followed by flavors of pepper, cinnamon and forest berries in this plucky Syrah. Spicy with a spin of tart fruit, the wine nevertheless has a full-bodied feel.",84,34,Cephalonia
127960,Italy,"The color of this vibrant Sicilian rosé (made with Nero d'Avola) is a deep pink raspberry and the wine's bouquet offers tones of cranberry, mature forest berry and blueberry skin. There's crisp spice in the mouth, but there's also a pungent sour note at the end.",83,12,Sicily & Sardinia
127970,Italy,"Pear, honeydew melon and floral note lift from the glass. The bright, no-frills palate offers up crisp apple and citrus peel while lively acidity provides a tangy finish.",87,16,Northeastern Italy
127980,US,"A split blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this shows a healthy mix of red currant and cranberry on the nose, with an mentholated herbal note adding lift. The palate is plush and round, with mildly grippy tannins and fresh, zippy red-fruit flavors.",87,79,Michigan
127990,Italy,"White blossom and apple aromas open on this vibrant white while the racy palate shows Kaiser pear, tangerine and a hint of mineral. Zesty acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",87,20,Northeastern Italy
128000,Italy,"This Brunello Riserva opens with a saturated garnet color and segues to aromas of blackberry, cherry, dried currants, leather, tar and Indian spice. There's a very nice juicy or chewy quality to the mouthfeel that gives the wine succulence and substance.",92,62,Tuscany
128010,US,"A classic Washington tasting-room Riesling—only better. Opulent and fruity, with apricots, star anise, mint, a very nice spicy streak that lifts it up, and adds a lot of complexity. Smooth and supple, it coats the palate, captures some floral highlights, even a bit of marshmallow.",92,11,Washington
128020,France,"A proper second wine, it's developing well with black fruits, acidity and good texture. It has plenty of flavor depth while the tannins are firmly in the background. Drink from 2017.",89,48,Bordeaux
128030,France,"Attractive, ripe and juicy, it has the tannic structure to support the full berry fruits, along with fine acidity. This is for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016.",89,53,Bordeaux
128040,Italy,"This brawny wine leads with aromas of blue flower, red berry, spice and a whiff of wet soil. The palate offers succulent wild cherry layered with notes of sweet vanilla, mint, espresso and thyme alongside rather angular tannins and evident alcohol.",89,50,Tuscany
128050,US,"Cherry liqueur akin to kirsch rises aromatically, along with a lavender perfume. Light and high-strung, this is a tightly wound wine, punched in acidity and savory tea. The finish displays bold swathes of oak.",88,32,California
128060,Italy,"Aromas of espresso, underbrush and black-skinned fruit lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, mature plum, clove, coffee and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,17,Tuscany
128070,US,"Sourced from three vineyard sites, this wine is named for the producer's wife and is his first attempt commercially with the variety. Smooth and silky in texture, it offers aromas that lean toward funky earth and dirt, with a touch of oak in the mix, too. Some soy and black tea finish things off.",88,60,California
128080,Chile,"Earthy aromas of leather, coffee grounds and blackberry are convincing. This feels full and ripe. Toasty plum and blackberry flavors offer notes of licorice and toast on a long, balanced finish.",89,12,Maule Valley
128090,France,"Soft notes of blossom adorn a dry, brisk and lean palate characterized by pithy grapefruit and lemon zest. Dry and light-footed, this wine provides a lip-smackingly bracing finish.",89,20,Alsace

128110,Spain,"Aromas of red plum and citrus qualify as raw and sharp. This is racy on the palate, with high acidity. Flavors of plum and cherry show mild spice and herbal shadings, while a tart red-fruit character is maintained across the finish.",85,12,Northern Spain
128120,US,"This starts out well, with sniffs and sips of blackberries and black cherries. That fruit does a quick fade, and drying tannins quickly take over the thin finish.",85,28,Oregon
128130,Portugal,"With some wood aging in French oak, the wine seems to have smoothed out the fruitiness. It is soft with a light spice and hints of green apple. The wine is ready to drink.",85,15,Lisboa
128140,US,"This is one of those Viogniers that's flashy and extravagant. If you're a Chardophile, it brings the same creamy, oaky sweetness and lifts it into the stratosphere, with scads of tropical fruits, sweet ripe pears, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla, brown sugared and cinnamon. Viognier hardly gets richer. Drink now.",91,42,California
128150,US,"This is a fine Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with robust cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and mushroom flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It shows all the hallmarks of a fine coastal Pinot. Drink over the next few years.",91,40,California
128160,France,"A fine example of what Tavel can be, this is a full-bodied, luscious rosé with a bit of sturdiness to its structure. Cherry and peach notes fade into hints of fresh herb and cocoa on the long, harmonious finish. Drink now and through the summer of 2014.",90,20,Rh?ne Valley
128170,US,"The aromas seem to lack clarity, with white flower and orange rind notes struggling to get to the surface. It drinks medium sweet with abundant floral and orange-peel flavors that provide appeal.",86,8,Washington
128180,Spain,"Clean nectarine and red plum aromas open this quaffable Garnacha rosé. Lightly salty stone-fruit flavors are pushed by bright acidity, which is about all that remains on a racy but mostly tasteless finish.",86,12,Northern Spain
128190,Chile,"Earthy cherry and berry aromas include a blackened note akin to asphalt. This feels fresh and wiry, with pointy acidity. Salty chippy red-fruit flavors end with pedestrian berry notes and a lasting dash of salt.",86,10,Maipo Valley
128200,Italy,"Aromas of toast, espresso, oak and sage come together in the glass. On the palate, notes of coconut and coffee accent a ripe core of wild cherry. Soft acidity and round tannins lend it an easy-drinking quality.",87,18,Tuscany

128220,Spain,"Dense blackberry, licorice, leather and herb aromas come together nicely on this Garnacha-Tempranillo blend.

128260,US,"Banana, clove and orange peel open for this sweet, slightly dilute white. Short finish of spring flowers.",80,12,Colorado
128270,US,"Monumentally detailed, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is impressive for its sheer volumetrics. Offers masses of blackberries, black currants, cherries and cassis.  Huge, dramatic, yet impeccably balanced and dry. Feels firm and ultrarefined in tannic structure, with graceful acidity offering a perfect counterpoint to the fruity richness. Just beautiful, and ageable for at least a decade.",97,65,California
128280,Portugal,"This is a new wine from Vinha Paz. It is right up to the standards of the vineyard's reds: a beautifully perfumed, ripe wine that has Encruzado in the blend. Rich, full of yellow and spicy fruits, it is both structured, toasty and intense. Drinkable now.",92,35,D?o
128290,US,"The grapes for this lovely wine come from the Dry Stack Vineyard and Fallenleaf, some of which is planted to the Sauvignon Musque clone. Zesty acidity takes the first punch, remaining brightly balanced and explosive on the palate, with additional hits of white peach, apricot and honey.",92,31,California
128300,Germany,"While shades of slate and saffron lend complexity and nuance, this semisweet wine is more a showcase of sumptuous yellow peach and pear flavors. Its high-toned acidity and delicate, lacy mouthfeel make it irresistibly gulpable.",92,28,Mosel
128310,US,"Good price for a Pinot Noir this elegant and delicious. It's dry and firm, with zesty acidity and some furry tannins. Flavors of raspberries, cola and buttered cinnamon toast lead to a long, spicy finish. Decant it an hour or two before drinking.",90,30,California
128320,Italy,"This austere Brunello opens with dusty, mineral notes of crushed white peppercorn and brimstone followed by cherry candy, licorice, cola and dried garden herb. The wine shows an interesting and complex bouquet that holds its own in terms of intensity. There isn't much fresh fruit, but the tannins are dusty and fine.",90,70,Tuscany
128330,Italy,"Sometimes Sangiovese Grosso, depending on the vineyard and the vintage, shows slightly green aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs like bay leaf and rosemary. This Brunello offers a glimpse of that with loads of bright cherry, blackberry and leather at the back. The close is bright and fresh.",90,62,Tuscany
128340,Chile,"Tropical aromas rise up and win you over. Bold and citrusy in the mouth, with crisp lime, green apple, grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. Zesty and remaining fruity until the end. A ripe, fresh, familiar wine done right.",88,12,Curicó and Leyda Valleys
128350,US,"A lovely example of Pinot Noir from one of the rare places in Washington that can do the flighty grape justice. It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity. Light touches of cedar and smoke wrap around fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry pie. It stops a little short at the moment, but that might just be a function of limited bottle age.",88,30,Washington
128360,France,"Rich, full and opulent, this is a honeyed, lush Condrieu probably best consumed by the end of 2015. Apricot and dried pineapple notes come across almost like a dry Sauternes, accented by lingering caramel and spice on the long finish.",94,71,Rh?ne Valley
128370,Germany,"Initially faint whiffs of saffron, tangerine and blossom catapult with intensity on the palate of this auslese. It's finely framed, but flavors of preserved peach, mango and honey are dense and concentrated, and cut with a long, linear streak of lime. Gorgeous now, but sure to intensify for decades to come.",94,120,Rheingau
128380,Italy,"Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of mature red berry, exotic spice and a whiff of purple flowers. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy red currants, crushed raspberries, clove, cinnamon and licorice alongside firm, silky tannins. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink through 2021.",93,180,Tuscany
128390,France,"This is a simple, creamy and toasty wine. It has fresh pear and quince flavors that are ripe and soft. With just the right amount of acidity, this attractively balanced wine is ready to drink.",84,26,Alsace
128400,Italy,"Funky aromas recall barnyard, wet earth and overripe black fruit. The rustic palate offers mature blackberry and gamy notes alongside fleeting tannins.",84,30,Sicily & Sardinia
128410,France,"This is a soft and fruity wine, bright with acidity and apple fruit flavors. It's light and crisp, an attractive wine that's ready to drink.",84,20,Alsace
128420,France,"Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.",94,72,Alsace
128430,France,"The second wine of Ausone is powerful with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it is ripe, with softness from the fruit and light extraction. It is a very fine wine, delicious with its acidity and its black-currant fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2024.",94,80,Bordeaux

128460,Germany,"The von Kesselstatt estate released four GG bottlings in 2009, and this wine was perhaps the least of them. It's very good nonetheless, with fresh, slightly floral aromas and bold flavors of baked apple and orange zest. There's a chunkiness in the mouth and a slight coarseness of texture compared to the others, but that's splitting hairs.",88,49,Mosel
128470,Italy,"Lagrein is a unique indigenous grape from northern Italy that offers plump, fruit-forward aromas and smooth richness in the mouth. This expression delivers all that within a very elegant and pristine context. Pair this wine with bean and barely soup or veal stew.",88,40,Northeastern Italy

129640,Chile,"The 2012 vintage was so hot in Chile that harvests came very early. Thus finding mature, complex SBs in this year won't be easy. This perennially excellent wine is as good as you'll find in 2012. Scallion, lime and other green aromas precede a zesty, hard-driving palate. Sea shell, grapefruit, lime and chervil flavors set up a tight, minerally finish.",90,30,Casablanca Valley
129650,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is subtle and restrained on first sniff, but only takes a few swirls to unlock its expressive aromas of blackberry, cassis, brown spice and undergrowth.

129680,Portugal,"Old vines in a field blend give a rich structured wine that has dark tannins and powerful black fruits. It is firm, very concentrated with dense fruit as much as dense tannins. This wine could still age another few months, so drink from 2017.",93,39,Douro
129690,Italy,"This brawny wine has intense aromas of plum, tobacco and spirit-soaked black cherries, with a hint of oak and leather.

129840,US,"The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced.

Tannins are stiff but not too rough; and the finish suggests that some American oak mayhave been used.",86,20,Washington

129870,Spain,"Cool, minty aromas of blueberry and blackberry set up a full, tannic palate, which is what you'd expect from a young Ribera del Duero.

129930,Spain,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended.
